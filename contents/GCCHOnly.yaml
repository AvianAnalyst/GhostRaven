 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for developing and maintaining appropriate Access Control policies and procedures that govern access management activities for their organization and users.

 Part 1:
 O365:
 The "Office 365 Information Security Policy" provides the overarching security guidance for Office 365. This document addresses the purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, compliance requirements, and required coordination among the various Microsoft organizations providing some level of support for the security of Office 365. Policies are distributed via SharePoint to personnel responsible for implementing access control policies and procedures.

 Part 2:
 O365:
 Standards and procedures to facilitate execution of the Office 365 Information Security Policy are documented in the Active Framework Controls, Office 365 SOPs, and service team-specific SOPs. These standards and procedures act as adjuncts to the security policy and provide implementation level requirements and details to carry out specific operational tasks. A detailed mapping of Office 365 SOPs are distributed via SharePoint to roles providing support for Office 365 security.
ac_1_b_implementation: |
 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for annually updating their Access Control policies and procedures.

 Part 1:
 O365:
 The Office 365 Information Security Policy is reviewed and updated at least annually or whenever a significant change occurs.

 Part 2:

 Customer Responsibility:
 All customers are responsible for identifying the account types for their organization in compliance with their organizational policies.  Customers using ADFS will configure their account types in their existing Active Directory infrastructure or they will configure account types in AAD.

 Guest access to SFB meetings, if enabled, allows anyone with a meeting invite to access the meeting lobby; this method of guest access is considered session access as no account is assigned to the guest user. The meeting organizer is responsible for establishing the identity of lobby participants before granting them access to the meeting. Government customers are responsible for disabling guest access to SFB meetings to remain compliant with FedRAMP standards as advised in “Office 365 Complementary Federal User Entity Control” .For more information, see the following TechNet article: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/gg398648.aspx

 O365:
 Office 365 has identified and selected three categories of accounts to support organizational missions/business functions: Service Team, Customer, and Service.

 Service team accounts are used individually by service team personnel to manage and administer Office 365. Service teams divide the service team account type into separate roles as required to meet separation of duties requirements.

 Customer accounts are used by customer users to access the Office 365 product. Customer accounts are managed by the customer, see the "Customer Responsibility" section of this control for more information. Service accounts are used by service team services to authenticate to servers and other services.
ac_2_b_implementation: |
 O365:
 Office 365 assigns account managers to each role type using IDM, which include workflows that enforce business rules.
ac_2_c_implementation: |
 O365:
 Service teams establish conditions for group/role membership by defining and enforcing conditions for each group/role in account management tools. In addition, service teams use JIT Tools to enforce additional, more granular conditions for privilege escalation and approval for interactive sessions.

 Office 365 establishes conditions for group and role membership based on least privilege necessary for a user to perform their assigned duties. Predetermined conditions are established when groups are created.
ac_2_d_implementation: |
 O365:
 Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is used to identify and control the access privileges of each service team personnel. Serice Teams define their roles in IDM which contain a list of eligibilities. Eligibilities vary depending on the role that a specified service team personnel will assume within the service team. Privileges are defined in the eligibilities and enforced by Active Directory.

 By default, these service team accounts initially belong to a security group that has remote system metadata read access, and no direct access to the production environment. If service team personnel need additional access to the production environment, they request that access and provide business justification using Just-In-Time (JIT) tools.
ac_2_e_implementation: |
 O365:
 In order to gain access to the production environment, service team personnel must first request access via the account management tools; access to the production environment is provided via security group membership. Approval to establish the account from the service team’s management is required for a service team administrator to be added to the appropriate security group. These approvals are tracked and enforced by account management tools.
ac_2_f_implementation: |
 O365:
 Account changes are managed through IDM in accordance with Office 365 GCC High and DoD Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The Office 365 Information Security Policy and rules have been defined in account management tools which provide an automated workflow that allows service teams to track account requests, approvals, creations, modifications, and deletions. Service team managers are responsible for approving account lifecycle events in account management tools, ensuring that Office 365 establishes, activates, modifies, disables, and removes accounts appropriately.
ac_2_g_implementation: |
 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers using ADFS are responsible for monitoring the use of information system accounts managed by their AD. See AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, and SI-4 for more details about these responsibilities.

 O365:
 Office 365 monitors the use of information system accounts in accordance with the AU family of security controls. Office 365 records the auditable events defined in AU-2 with the content defined in AU-3 and monitors those records in accordance with the control descriptions for AU-6 and SI-4.
ac_2_h_implementation: |
 Part 1,2,3:
 O365:
 Office 365 uses  account management tools that allow service teams to track the account management process through account request, approval, creation, modification, and deletion. As changes occur, the corresponding account manager is notified of the changes that require their approval. Information system usage and need-to-know are mapped to the roles defined by each service team. When an employee is transferred or their employment is terminated, the account management tools will automatically revoke the associated account's access to the privileges mapped to their previous role.

 AFS, Bing, CIA, EXO, IP, IS, Loki, MSTeams, ORAS, OSI, SCS, SFB, SPO, SUE, WAC:
 Office 365 GCC High and DoD Membership in security groups that give access to the system is given only to those in specific roles that require system access. Service team managers are responsible for approving group membership. Service team personnel with the access approver role then review and approve or deny the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time (no more than 24 hours) based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, Torus assigns the service team personnel to eligibilities with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period. The managers validate the eligibilities requested and justification provided and grant access once validated.
ac_2_j_implementation: |
 O365:
 The Office 365 service teams review service team administrator accounts at least monthly.

 Office 365 (Privacy):
 The Office 365 service teams review service team administrator accounts at least quarterly.
 A ticket is opened for each security group that allows access to Office 365 and the security group owner reviews service team administrator membership for accuracy. If any discrepancies are found, they are noted in the ticket and a change is initiated in account management tools.

ac_2_k_implementation: |
 O365:
 Office 365 does not allow the use of shared/group user accounts. Individual service engineers are assigned into a security group, and in order to use these credentials, a user must go through multifactor authentication to uniquely identify their credentials.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for automatically terminating temporary and emergency government customer accounts, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure (no more than 30 days for FedRAMP compliance). Government users authenticate to government managed ADFS servers which utilize the government AD infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and apply permissions to that user’s session. The government ADFS server then communicates that identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via SAML2.0 ticket.

 For information regarding how to manage user accounts in AD, see TechNet article #754661: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754661.aspx

 O365:
 IDM is an automated workflow management tool that allows service teams to manage service team administrator and service accounts through account request, approval, creation, modification, and deletion. IDM integrates with Microsoft Online Directory Service (MSODS) to provide identity synchronization, certificate management, service team administrator password resets and service team administrator provisioning from a single interface. Service team managers are responsible for approving requests in IDM.

 By default, service team AD accounts belong to a security group that only has read access to the production environment. Additionally, if a service team administrator needs elevated privileges to the production environment, they request that access, providing a business justification using JIT tools. A service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, JIT tools assign the service team administrator to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period.

 Bing and SCS also use MyAccess to manage security groups, which are used to gain access to Azure PaaS services, Source Depot, and configuration files.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for automatically terminating temporary and emergency government customer accounts, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure (within 24 hours for FedRAMP compliance). Government users authenticate to government managed ADFS servers which utilize the government AD infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and apply permissions to that user’s session. The government ADFS server then communicates that identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via SAML2.0 ticket.

 For information regarding how to manage user accounts in AD, see TechNet article #754661: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754661.aspx.

 O365:
 Office 365 performs automated auditing of privileged service team accounts through account management tools, which provide a record of account creation, modification, disabling, and termination of accounts. A notification is sent to the account manager when accounts are changed or managed in any way.

 Auditing of Azure Portal accounts is inherited from Azure Government, which has a FedRAMP IaaS/PaaS P-ATO (package ID F1603087869). Azure performs auditing of privileged user accounts through an event forwarding tool, which provides a record of all changes made to accounts and notifies the Security Incident Management (SIM) team for any suspicious activities.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for establishing and administering privileged user accounts with a role-based access scheme that organizes Office 365 customer privileges into roles in compliance with their organizational policies.

 Government customers using ADFS will manage their account roles in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory, see TechNet article #754661: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754661.aspx

 O365:
 All service team personnel accounts are considered privileged. Service team users are assigned to security roles, which have a defined list of available permissions. By default, service team accounts belong to a security group that only has remote access to read system metadata, and no direct access to the production environment. If a service team user needs elevated privileges to the production environment, they must request that access and provide a business justification using Just-In-Time (JIT) tools. A service team user with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, JIT tools assign the service team user to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revoke permissions at the end of the specified time period.

 For OSI and some IS teams, service team personnel are assigned a role within their service team that corresponds to a security group. Each security group is assigned permissions to correlating environments with just enough access to properly fulfill their tasks. Service team managers are responsible for approving role assignments.
ac_2_7_b_implementation: |
 O365:
 All service team accounts are considered privileged, and are tracked and monitored using automated account management tools. For service teams that require Just-In-Time elevated access to the production environment, role assignments are tracked and monitored through JIT tools.
ac_2_7_c_implementation: |
 O365:
 Privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate when Office 365 personnel no longer have need of the role to support their current work, or if their employment with Microsoft is terminated. In those cases, Office follows the account management workflows to disable the account or revoke access.

 The system has the capability of terminating a user session on the Terminal Services Gateway (TSG) immediately. The TSGs are managed by ORAS or inherited from Azure. First, the account associated with the user is disabled, then the session is terminated on the TSG. This prevents the user from further remote access of the system.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers using ADFS are responsible for enforcing the appropriate usage and time-based usage restrictions for all customer-controlled accounts.

 O365:
 Office 365 requires the use of Torus, an internal Just-In-Time (JIT) access control tool, to access the production environment. Requests for access through Torus must be approved by an eligibility owner and there are limitations to the access granted:
 •	JIT sessions have a default TTL of 4 hours and cannot exceed 24 hours
 •	Sessions are also task-based – all requests must include a justification and grant a restricted set of permissions that are scoped to the requested task
 •	The management forest for Torus is isolated from, and does not trust, the management forests of other service teams, further protecting access control mechanisms from compromise

 This process can be circumvented only in the event of an emergency through the use of a “breakglass” account. There are very few of these accounts and use of one creates a Sev 1 alert to the incident response team.

 O365:
 The O365 Security Incident & Response (SIR) team is notified by MSIT Corporate Security to monitor users that pose significant risk. Account management tools synchronize with the Human Resources Information System (HRIS). When a service team user is marked as disabled in HRIS, this information propagates to account management tools, which then automatically deactivates the service team domain account. Any accounts associated with the Microsoft user are disabled in real time.

 Government customers are responsible for enforcing approved authorizations for logical access to the system, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Government users authenticate to government owned ADFS servers which utilize the government AD infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and apply permissions to that user’s session. The government ADFS server then communicates that identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via SAML2.0 ticket. Once permissions are communicated to AAD, AAD is responsible for enforcing those permissions for the user’s Office 365 session.

 For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory, see TechNet article #754661: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754661.aspx

 O365:
 Office 365 service teams enforce approved authorizations for logical access using role-based access control enforced by AD and Azure Active Directory (AAD). Office 365 uses AD to implement role-based access control (RBAC) via the use of AD groups. For the purposes of this control, the term "security group" references an AD group which is used to enforce RBAC permissions.

 Office 365 service teams are responsible for managing security groups in the production domain. Office 365 has three major account types: service team, customer, and service. Service team accounts are used by service team personnel to manage and administer Office 365 Customer accounts are used by customer users to access Office 365. Service accounts are used by various services to authenticate to servers and other services.

 O365:
 Office 365 implements information flow control by allowing only connections and communication which are necessary to allow systems to operate, blocking all other ports, protocols and connections by default. This includes intra-service communications as well as connections to external information systems. Access Control Lists (ACLs) restrict network communications by source and destination networks, protocols, and port numbers.

 Office 365 manages ACL approvals through the Request For Change (RFC) process (including review and risk acceptance) and the change process, and Azure Government implements the approved change. Approved mechanisms to implement networked-based ACLs include: ACLs on routers managed by Azure Government and firewall rules.

 The use of firewall rules and ACLs allows Office 365 to control the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems. The use of the RFC process ensures that data flows are authorized and approved.

 Office 365 separates all information flows logically using user session encryption. TLS 1.2 ensures the confidentiality and integrity of each flow; only the intended recipient can decrypt information. Additionally, each Office 365 customer is placed in a separate Organizational Unit (OU) within Active Directory. Customer content within Office 365 is always tied to the customer’s specific OU and Office 365 GCC will only grant access to the data if there is a valid ticket from AAD authorizing access to the OU and the specific data.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for separating duties of their organizational users as necessary, to prevent malevolent activity without collusion in compliance with their organizational policies.
 Government customers using ADFS will manage their user accounts in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. For information regarding how to manage user accounts in Active Directory, see TechNet article #754661: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754661.aspx

 AFS, Bing CIA, EXO, IP, IS, Loki, MSTeams, ORAS, OSI, SCS, SFB, SPO,SUE, Wac:
 Service team administrators are assigned to roles, which have a defined list of available permissions (RBAC). The separation of duties is documented through eligibilities (roles) assigned to service team administrators in account management tools. Each service team identifies roles that, if shared by a single person, would allow for malicious activity without collusion. When such role pairs exist, no individual is allowed to belong to both roles. Account permissions and role access are reviewed as part of the monthly account review process.
 Additionally, some service team administrators are required to request privileged access to the production environment and provide a business justification using JIT tools. A different service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and either approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, the JIT tools assign the service team administrator the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revoke permissions at the end of the specified time period.
 Implementing access control using JIT tools effectively prevents malevolent activity without collusion, as an individual has to review and approve the requestor's access request and would deny requests that would violate separation of duties requirements.

 Office 365 service teams employ the concept of least privilege documented in account management tools, allowing only authorized accesses for service team users (and processes acting on behalf of service team users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational need.

 Service owners must employ the concept of least privilege for specific duties and information systems in accordance with risk assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to operational assets, individuals, and/or other organizations. service team administrator permissions and segregation of duties are defined in AC-5. Each service team is responsible for defining least privileged roles within their team. Roles are documented within account management tools.

 For teams using JIT tools, by default, service team accounts belong to a security group that only has remote metadata access to the environment for that service team. This does not permit direct environment access, or access to customer content. If a service team administrator needs other privileges to the production environment, they must request that access and provide a business justification using JIT tools. A service team administrator with the access approver role then reviews and approves or denies the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, the JIT tool assigns the service team administrator to security groups with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period.

 The use of this Just-In-Time permissions model ensures that service team administrators only ever have the least privileges required to accomplish assigned tasks in support of Office 365 mission and business functions, restricted by elevation level, resource access, and time.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for explicitly authorizing access to security functions, as defined by their organization, in compliance with their organizational policies, using their Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Government users authenticate to government owned ADFS servers which utilize the government AD infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and apply permissions to that user’s session. The government ADFS server then communicates that identification/authentication and the associated permissions to AAD via SAML2.0 ticket.

 For information regarding how to manage user accounts in AD, see TechNet article #754661: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754661.aspx

 O365:
 Service teams employ the concept of least privilege, allowing only pre-authorized accesses for service team administrators (and processes acting on behalf of service team administrators) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational need.
 Service owners employ the concept of least privilege for specific duties and information systems (including specific ports, protocols, and services) in accordance with risk assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to operational assets, individuals, and/or other organizations.

 All access to the Office 365 system must be explicitly authorized, including the following security related functions: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and system and security administration. Role owners are responsible for reviewing and approving role assignments, and roles are tailored for different job functions such that personnel only have the minimum access required to perform their duties. For some teams, service team accounts by default belong to a security group that only has user-level operating system access to the production environment for that service team--this does not permit access to customer content. Access to any higher level of permissions must be requested through JIT tools and authorized by the on-call approver.

 Through the use of this just in time model, Office 365 explicitly authorizes access to security functions.

 Government customers using ADFS are responsible for auditing account creation, modification, disabling, and deletion events for their Active Directory infrastructure as these events also pertain to Office 365 access. For these events, these customers are responsible for capturing what type of event occurred, when (date and time) the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome (success or failure) of the event, and the identity of any user/subject associated with the event. Customers using Windows servers to support their ADFS infrastructure automatically meet this requirement as Windows captures these event details by default. For more information regarding Windows event logging, see the following link: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc765981.aspx

 O365:
 Office 365 includes the execution of privileged functions in the list of events to be audited by the system.

 All commands run by all accounts are logged. Non-privileged actions (for example, browsing the public internet, use of email clients, etc.) are not allowed within the production environment. Additionally, some teams use just in time (JIT) tools to allow privileged access to be granted within the production environment. Execution of privileged functions using JIT tools is audited.

 Government customers using ADFS are responsible for enforcing a limited number of consecutive invalid login attempts by a user during a defined time period in compliance with their organizational policies (not more than three attempts in 15 minutes for FedRAMP compliance). These customers will manage their account lockout policies in their existing Active Directory infrastructure. For information regarding account lockout policies, see the following link: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh994563%28v=ws.10%29.aspx

 O365:
 Office 365 has implemented an integrated defense against brute force attacks on privileged accounts rather than enforcing the FedRAMP recommendation of locking an account after 3 failed attempts in 15 minutes using AD Group Policy. Group Policy Object (GPO) settings cover password authentication to endpoints. Access to endpoints first requires two-factor authentication. Office 365 leverages the PIN lockout feature on YubiKeys to enforce a lockout after 6 consecutive failed attempts. regardless of time. All Office 365 remote administration requires multi-factor authentication.

 Office 365 has adopted this alternative implementation as an operational requirement in order to ensure that customers have the ability to implement an organizationally specified policy for these same account settings. In addition, engineer accounts in the Office 365 domains (including the just in time (JIT) account created when an engineer needs elevated privileges) have machine generated random 15-character passwords which significantly increases the potential cost of a brute force attempt. This alternative implementation is being tracked in POA&Ms ITAR-057 and ITAR-066.

 O365:
 Office 365 leverages the PIN lockout feature on YubiKeys to enforce a lockout after 6 consecutive failed attempts regardless of time.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers connect to Office 365 via the following allowed methods of remote access: web interface via web browser, email or SFB software client, or PowerShell client. These methods are documented in Office 365 Complementary Federal User Entity Control.

 Government customers are responsible for ensuring that client software is configured to only establish sessions using FIPS 140-2 validated protocols. This can be accomplished by restricting access to the government customer’s ADFS to only internal network traffic. This will force government customers attempting to connect to Office 365 to VPN into the customer’s network or directly be on the network at the time of authentication. When the customer connects (directly or via VPN) to the network it should perform a health inspection that validates USGCB baselines including browser settings to require FIPS 140-2 connections.
 For more information about configuring customer ADFS server(s) to only allow connections from customer internal networks, see the following TechNet article: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh526961(v=ws.10).aspx

 O365:
 Office 365 personnel do not have physical access to datacenters. Each service team implements remote access through the use of a Terminal Services Gateway (TSG) managed by ORAS or inherited from Azure to gain remote access to Office 365. Government customers do not have access to authenticate to GCC via the TSGs.

 Usage restrictions and connection/configuration requirements for Office 365 personnel are established in the Terminal Services Gateways by Active Directory-managed Group Policy. These policies include the bulleted implementation guidance of configuration/connection requirements listed below and are available for review:
 •	TSG servers are configured to only use FIPS 140-2 validated encryption
 •	TSG sessions are configured to disconnect after 10 minutes of inactivity
 •	TSG sessions are configured to automatically log off after 24 hours, terminating the network session
ac_17_b_implementation: |
 Customer Responsibility:
 Remote access is how government customers are expected to interact with Office 365. Office 365 expects all government customers to have remote access. Government customers are responsible for authorizing their users to access Office 365 and in doing so authorize them to use the system remotely. By default, customers do not have remote access to Office 365 until an account is created for them by their customer administrator.

 O365:
 All approved maintenance activities are authorized for execution via remote access to the Office 365 environment. The system devices reside in data centers geographically segregated from the operations teams. Personnel local to the data centers do not have logical access to information system components. As a result, the only way to perform maintenance is remotely.

 Microsoft personnel are required to connect to the Terminal Services Gateways (TSG) using equipment which complies with Microsoft Corporate Network security configurations. Further, the TSGs are configured to prevent remote machines from extracting information from the Office 365 environment; copy/paste is disabled, printing is disabled, and file transfers are disabled. This limits the ability for malicious software on remote clients to compromise the Office 365 environment. ORAS or Azure is responsible for the implementation and configuration of the TSGs.

Government customers are required to configure workstations to establish FIPS 140-2 validated TLS sessions for remote access in order to retain compliance with FedRAMP requirements. This can be accomplished by restricting access to the government customer’s ADFS to only internal network traffic. This will force government customers attempting to connect to Office 365 to VPN into the customer’s network or directly be on the network at the time of authentication.

 Office 365 uses FIPS 140-2-validated cryptography to encrypt Terminal Services Gateway (TSG) connections to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions. For teams using Azure managed TSGs, this is inherited from Azure.
 FIPS encryption as handled by Microsoft products is further explained in TechNet article cc750357: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/cc750357.aspx

 Office 365 's FIPS 140-2 encryption modules used for transmitted information are certified by NIST via certificates 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 2351, 2352, 2353, 2354, 2355, 2356, 2357, 2931, 2932, 2933, 2934, 2935, 2936, 2937, and 2938.

 The non-inclusion of Windows Server 2012 on the updated list of validated FIPS 140-2 modules is solely due to the significant backlog of work required to update the Security Policy documents and submit Change Letters to NIST CMVP for Microsoft’s many FIPS 140-2 validation certificates. Windows Server 2012 provides and uses the AES_CTR_DRBG algorithm as the default deterministic random bit generator. Note the statement from http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-historical.htm:

 “This does not mean that the overall FIPS-140 certificate has been revoked, rather it indicates that the certificate and the documentation posted with it do not accurately reflect how the module can be used in FIPS mode. Agencies may make a risk determination on whether to continue using the modules on this list based on their own assessment of where and when the RNG is used by the module.”

 Again, the deprecated RNG is not in use by default in Windows Server 2008. Office 365 developers are prevented from choosing unapproved DRBG or RNG algorithms by the code reviewing processes described in the SA family of the SSP.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for routing remote access traffic to Office 365 through a limited number of managed access points. Further information is available in CA-3(3).

 O365:
 Office 365 Service teams implement remote access through the use of specially configured Terminal Services Gateways (TSGs) as the only approved way to gain remote administrative access to service team systems. Additionally, some service teams require the use of Secure Access Workstations (SAWs) to establish remote sessions into the Office 365 production environment via the TSGs.  Each service team has a load-balanced pool of TSGs in two geographically-distributed data centers. TSGs are managed by ORAS or Azure for Office 365.

 In addition to access through the TSG, service engineers can access certain administrative functionality on the production servers through the use of Remote PowerShell sessions. In order to do this, a user will be authorized for read only (debug) access to the production environment. Privilege escalation is enabled the same way it is enabled for RDP using JIT tooling. There exists a load-balanced virtual IP at each data center which serves as a single point of access to the functionality enabled by this service. The Remote PowerShell cmdlets that can be executed are enumerated based on the privilege level identified in the access claim obtained during authentication. These cmdlets are the only administrative functionality that can be accessed and executed by users connecting using this method.

 Microsoft will not implement a mechanism to enforce security requirements of hosts accessing the system via the internet. The functionality to support NAP has been deprecated. This is being tracked as an operational requirement in POA&M ITAR-056.

 Office 365 only allows remote connections via remote desktops. These remote desktop sessions are locked down to only allow very limited and specific access. This access does not allow broad network access into production by the remote machines. The network access is limited to one specific protocol, and traffic is only allowed to specific bastion machines.

 Additionally, Office 365 has implemented compensating controls outlined below:
 •	Minimal amount of data can be copied. There is a buffer limit on the clipboard.
 •	Office 365 requires Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
 •	The Office 365 Security Incident Response capability is improved through unifying the available remote access methods.
 •	Office 365 requires Just-In-Time (JIT) access, limiting access into production.
 •	External devices are logically prevented from connecting to the production environment.
 •	Aggressive idle time-outs are in place.
 •	All Office 365 administrators are required to take security training.

 O365:
 Office 365 provides security and privacy awareness training to all information system users (including managers, senior executives, and contractors) as part of initial training for new users. This is accomplished by requiring all staff to take a New Employee Orientation (NEO) security awareness training course, Standards of Business Conduct, within the first 30 days of their employment or transfer into the organization. This training course is facilitated by Core Services Engineering (CSE) and Corporate Security, and encompasses standard business security measures, basic information security, and user actions to maintain security and to respond to suspected security incidents.

 In addition, all staff are required to take security and privacy awareness training annually after their initial training. Office 365 has implemented the security training control by requiring all new users (employees and contractors) to take the initial security and privacy awareness training annually. Non-operational personnel, anyone that is involved in development and quality assurance, are also required to take the mandatory training. In addition, training related to the system being accessed, along with associated procedures, may be required. Security training is also required when there is a significant change to the system environment.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers using ADFS are responsible for auditing account creation, modification, disabling, and deletion events for their Active Directory infrastructure as these events also pertain to Office 365 access. For these events, these government customers are responsible for capturing what type of event occurred, when (date and time) the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome (success or failure) of the event, and the identity of any user/subject associated with the event. Government customers using Windows servers to support their ADFS infrastructure automatically meet this requirement as Windows captures these event details by default. For more information regarding Windows event logging, see the following link: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc765981.aspx

 O365:
 Per the Office 365 Security team, auditable events are required to contain the following information at a minimum to establish what events occurred, the sources of the events, and the outcomes of the events:
  • Source User ID
  • Target User ID – as relevant/appropriate for event type
  • Event timestamp (Date & Time)
  • Event details
   o	Type
   o	Outcome (success/failure)
   o	Detail information – defined per event type
  • Source & Target Hostname – as relevant/appropriate for event type
  • Source & Target network addresses and protocols – as relevant/appropriate for event type

 This information is sufficient to identify the event type, source, location, outcome, time and the entity associated with the event (device or user). All auditable events captured in Windows event logs contain the minimum information required and, in many cases, additional information is captured. Office 365 does not filter any of the content generated.

 O365:
 Office 365 provides centralized management and configuration of audit record generation through policies set by the Office 365 Security Team. By default, the Windows OS captures all security logs deemed necessary by Office 365 policy. An agent is installed on all in-boundary servers that allows Office 365 Security to orchestrate the transport of these logs for processing and cold storage.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers using ADFS are responsible for auditing account creation, modification, disabling, and deletion events for their Active Directory infrastructure as these events also pertain to Office 365 access. For these events, these customers are responsible for allocating audit record storage capacity and configuring auditing to reduce the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded. For more information regarding configuring event logging in Windows, including setting the maximum log size, see the following link: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766178.aspx

 O365:
 Office 365 utilizes a repository service to store audit information. The repository service dynamically allocates audit storage space to Office 365. If it nears the limits of the storage capacity currently allocated, additional space is automatically assigned; the likelihood of audit storage capacity being exceeded is reduced by this dynamic model where allocated audit storage capacity grows with need. The repository service keeps at minimum ten petabytes free at any given time for dynamic allocation.

 Azure Government is responsible for managing all network device logs. Azure Government implements audit storage capacity through a capacity planning procedure of both processing and storage requirements to ensure adequate resources are available for Azure Government. Due to the high volume of events received on servers and network devices, Azure Government audit collection settings are to overwrite when capacity is exceeded. Azure Government currently defines baseline requirements for local security audit log storage capacity to a window of at least 10 minutes of events on even Azure Government’s most-active hosts. Events are continuously sent to the Syslog and Windows Event Collector, which are monitored by the C+AI Security Engineering Team, that have adequate storage capacity to handle the volume of events captured. In addition, collector data is archived via the event archive process for Syslog and Windows Event Collector, which are maintained for 180 days. In the event of an audit failure or audit storage capacity being reached, monitoring tools generate near-real time alerts to the C+AI Security Engineering Team, who are assigned to address the processing failure.

 O365:
 Office 365 Security team continuously correlates log files across multiple Office 365 service teams using automated analytics tools. Time stamps are precise at least to the millisecond.
 Office 365 implements audit generation through configuring all system network devices and servers to have the capability to generate audit records as defined in AU-2 and AU-3. All events defined in AU-0\2 are being logged by Office 365 systems. Audit logs are uploaded to a repository service from all servers in the Office 365 environment, where they are correlated across service teams. This allows for the record generation capability and convergence of monitoring data for the auditable events in AU-2 and AU-3.

 To provide a time correlated audit trail, all Office 365 system devices are time correlated and store time in UTC format. Office 365 uses stratum 1 clock sources in the US. From there, every DCR (pair of redundant core Azure datacenter routers) provides clock to the Office 365 datacenter devices. The overall approach is to use the DCRs as NTP servers. The DCRs synchronize off the authoritative stratum 1 time sources, with Microsoft equipment synchronizing off of the DCRs. The same IP addresses for NTP are configured on the DCRs in each datacenter, with routing tables being used to determine the closest source to any given client (similar to an Anycast style solution). These IP addresses are in management IP space and synchronization is done over the management network. The tolerance for the correlation process is under one second.

 Office 365 servers are configured to synchronize time every 5 minutes through Office 365 managed Domain Controllers. The Office 365 time servers sync off of Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.

 Teams that use Azure inherit Internal system clock synchronization from Azure Government, which has a FedRAMP IaaS/PaaS P-ATO (package ID F1603087869).

 Office 365 will assess security controls in the information system and its environment of operation at least annually. The controls will be assessed as part of the continuous monitoring process using a 3PAO-certified independent assessor as required. Other criteria, such as major system changes and changes in risk posture and vulnerabilities, will trigger assessments.

 If an external system with which Office 365 maintains an interconnection has a FedRAMP P-ATO, Office 365 will leverage that P-ATO. Any system without a FedRAMP P-ATO from which security controls are inherited will be reviewed by the independent assessor with respect to security controls inherited from that system.

 Office 365 employs an onboarding process for new features that do not change the security posture of the information system as described in the FedRAMP attestation guidance document. This process includes gathering evidence of compliance with security controls at the time of onboarding the team to the environment. The 3PAO reviews the onboarding evidence and attests to the readiness of the new services.

  O365:
  Office 365 PAVC works with service teams to establish and document configuration settings as a part of establishing a baseline configuration and implementing configuration change control. Mandatory configuration settings are applied through the use of GPOs, setting of registry keys, and use of configuration scripts. Input to these configuration settings and scripts comes from product architecture and security analysis as well as direction from O365 Security.

  Office 365 uses applicable and relevent CIS Benchmarks in the development of baseline configurations and configuration settings for Windows Server.

  Configuration settings established as part of an IPAK and VM OS images are inherited from Azure. Azure C+AI develops baseline configurations for Server baseline(s) in the Azure environment. For network devices, the Azure Network engineering teams define the approved baseline configurations based on industry best practices and recommendations from the hardware manufacturers.

  The Office 365 PAVC team uses Microsoft internal tooling to perform scans for configuration settings. This tooling scans against CIS/STIG benchmarks settings on Office 365 servers on a monthly basis. The implementation of reporting for CIS/STIG scan results is being tracked in POA&M ITAR-081.

  O365:
  Office 365 Service team personnel use automated deployment mechanisms and documented standard operating procedures to implement the mandatory configuration settings for all servers, network devices, and applications.

  O365:
  Office 365 has determined that enforcing strict software whitelisting poses unacceptable risks to system availability. This is being tracked as an operational requirement in ITAR-059 DEFENSE.

  To compensate for this, Office 365 uses standardized deployment processes that ensure that server roles are configured reliably and consistently across the service.  There is no manual configuration and thus no risk of accidental deviations. Office 365 MT frequently redeploys the service using these standardized deployment processes.  This provides defense-in-depth against change controls being circumvented because manual changes will be quickly overwritten.

  Additionally, Integrity verification of core Windows files is implemented using System File Checker (SFC) and Windows Resource Protection (WRP). Office 365 performs vulnerability scanning daily, which can detect vulnerable software and provide defense-in-depth if change controls are somehow circumvented.

  Office 365 also performs a manual reconciliation of its software inventory against software identified by scanning and discrepancies are investigated.

 O365:
 The detection of unauthorized hardware components is inherited from Azure. As documented in Decision Log “Monitoring and alerting of attached unauthorized devices in the Data Centers (AC-19)”, Azure Government has concluded that their physical and screening controls prevent a malicious individual from gaining physical access to the Office 365 hardware and connecting unapproved devices. Office 365 systems are housed in physically separate cages with strict physical access control. Additionally, Azure Government personnel have no logical access to Office 365 systems.

 Office 365 near-real time monitoring tools detect the presence of unauthorized software and firmware components. If unauthorized software or firmware is detected, a workflow is initiated to isolate and disable network access by the software or firmware component and notify Office 365 Security.

 Office 365 does not generate an alert when a new machine is brought into the information system boundary; this has been identified as an operational requirement and can be tracked in ITAR-085 GCCH.

 Uplifting the amount of alerting and logging every time a machine goes online will dilute the logging, resulting in ignored logs and decreased effectiveness in resolving high-priority issues. This would create undue burden on security operations with little benefit.

 To compensate for this, deployments into Office 365 are tightly controlled through a series of access controls, change management processes and deployment controls. Each change is tracked, peer reviewed and approved before any change (including hardware and VMs) are pushed into the environment. Also, service team operators must use 2FA and provide a valid justification to log into the environment. PAVC scans are periodically run to detect blacklisted/inappropriate connections.

 Each Office 365 service team establishes an alternate processing site, including necessary agreements to permit the resumption of all information system operations for essential missions and business functions within the recovery times documented in each service team’s BIA when the primary processing capabilities are unavailable.

 Active alternate sites have been established for each of the service teams. All alternate sites are active sites as detailed in the specific BCP for each service team. Each alternate site is redundant and managed by Azure Government. The recovery agreements with Azure Government are in accordance with the recovery time objectives established within the BIA.

 O365:
 Office 365 ensures that equipment and supplies, required to resume operations, are available at the alternate site, or contracts are in place to support delivery to the site in time to support the time period for resumption defined in each service team’s BIA.

 Because each site is operationally active, both the primary and the alternate site contain identical equipment to support ongoing production of the system due to a disruption at the other location. The recovery agreements with Azure Government are in accordance with the recovery time objectives established within the BIA.

  Customer Responsibility:
  Government customers are responsible for uniquely identifying and authenticating their organizational users via their Active Directory infrastructure. When a user of an organization employing ADFS attempts to access Office 365, the user is redirected to a login page hosted on the customer’s ADFS server. The user provides their credentials to their ADFS server, which attempts to authenticate the credentials using the customer’s existing Active Directory infrastructure. If the credentials are authenticated, the customer’s ADFS server issues a SAML ticket containing information about the user’s identity and group membership. The customer ADFS server signs this ticket using one half of an asymmetric key pair and the user sends the ticket to Azure Active Directory (AAD) via encrypted TLS 1.2. AAD validates the signature using the other half of the asymmetric key pair and grants access based on the ticket. Customers are responsible for enforcing organizationally appropriate identification and authentication requirements at their ADFS server, including the use of unique identifiers.

  For more information on Active Directory object naming, see TechNet article 977992: http://Technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc977992.aspx

  O365:
  The service teams maintain Active Directory (AD) and AAD deployments for identifying and authenticating Microsoft users in the environment. Office 365 personnel accessing Office 365 are uniquely identified by their AD or AAD username and authenticate using Identity Assurance Level (IAL), Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL), Federation Assurance Level (FAL) level 3 and FIPS 140-2 validated Yubikeys or approved IAL, AAL, FAL level 3and FIPS 140-2 validated TPM modules. AD strictly enforces unique identifiers.

  Office 365 uses Active Directory (AD) to uniquely identify and authenticate all devices within the Office 365 boundary before establishing a network connection. All Office 365 physical servers are joined to an AD domain when deployed. Active Directory Forest members are uniquely identified by Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) with device authentication performed using Kerberos, which is a part of the Windows networking protocols.

  Virtual machines are identified by the virtual machine deployment ID assigned by Azure and authenticated via TSL certificates managed as part of the Azure provisioning process. When establishing a Microsoft Azure subscription, a subscription ID is created. The Fabric Controller (FC), which manages all VMs in Microsoft Azure, uses this subscription ID to tie VMs to particular subscriptions. For more information about the Fabric Controller see the Azure SSP.

  For teams managed by PilotFish, an identity certificate is distributed to every machine on a PilotFish cluster. Each identity certificate contains a unique identifier (machine name), the environment, and machine function (server role).

  O365:
  YubiKeys are distributed by Office 365 Security and require an enrollment process before they can be utilized for access to the environment.
  Initial service team domain passwords are distributed automatically by account management tools, which identifies and authenticates Office 365 service team administrators based on their CorpNet credentials before providing the password. The passwords for domain administrator accounts not tied to account management tools are set by administrators at the time of their creation.

  Devices are identified during the provisioning process based on information provided by Azure; the domain joining process in Active Directory (AD) ensures that the correct identifier is assigned.

  SFB:
  Office 365 uses 3 types of authenticators: AD passwords (as part of AD accounts), physical token certificates, and server certificates. Passwords are automatically managed through AD as part of standard account management. Office 365 manages YubiKeys, YubiKey distribution, and the supporting PKI infrastructure. The PKI infrastructure includes a root CA located in the management domain, which is used both as the trust anchor for YubiKey authentication mechanisms and a discreet encryption module that services certificate generation requests made by the root CA. The root CA is also located in the management domain. The certificates used to authenticate session layer communications (RDP, TLS 1.2) are either obtained from a customer specified vendor or by an identified trust anchor within the service offering. External certificates are obtained through the Office 365 SAN Certificate Request Process and moved into the environment using the secure File Relay Tool. Internal certificates are generated within the environment using CertDojo.

  Office 365 manages initial authenticator distribution for YubiKeys. Personnel local to the Microsoft campus are required to be issued in person and have their identity verified against either a valid government issued ID or a Microsoft Corporate badge.

  For personnel remote to the main Microsoft campus, the YubiKey may be mailed via FedEx.
  Devices are identified during the provisioning process based on information provided by Azure; the domain joining process in Active Directory ensures that the correct identifier is assigned.

ia_5_c_implementation: |
  O365:
  Office 365 ensures that authenticators are sufficiently strong by configuring AD such that passwords must comply with Windows strong password requirements and be at least 14 characters in length. Windows strong passwords must contain characters from at least three of these four categories:
   • English lowercase
   • English uppercase
   • Numbers (0-9)
   • Special characters

  Device authenticators are set automatically by Active Directory as part of the domain joining process. All certificates within Office 365 employs the Microsoft RSA Channel Cryptographic Provider and have a bit length of 2048. This applies to certificates obtained from vendors as well as internally generated certificates, both YubiKeys and server certificates.
ia_5_d_implementation: |
  O365:
  Microsoft's Global Security Account Management (GSAM) team has established and implemented procedures for handling YubiKey distribution, for dealing with lost/compromised/damaged YubiKeys, and for revoking YubiKey certificates. These procedures are available at the GSAM SharePoint site.

  YubiKey distribution is described in part (a) of this control. If a card is reported lost or damaged, the certificates on the card are immediately revoked and a new YubiKey is issued. In other situations requiring revocation (personnel termination, for example), GSAM follows procedures for immediate certificate revocation and a new card is not issued.

  Service team domain account passwords are set by Office 365 service team administrators. This process is followed for initial password distribution and if a password is forgotten. Passwords are not "revoked"; rather, the account is disabled in situations requiring revocation.

  When an Office 365 service team administrator forgets their YubiKey PIN, they must submit a reset request. The certificate issued to the YubiKey expires after one year; however, administrators can log onto the renewal server to renew the certificate at any point in the year. The PIN is considered a Pre-Shared Key which AD uses as part of the authenticator validation process. This control is partially inherited from Core Services Engineering (CSE, formerly MSIT).
  Device authenticators are automatically managed by Active Directory.

  • Enforce password history = 24 passwords remembered
  • Maximum password age = 60 days
  • Minimum password age = 0 days

  The YubiKey expires after one year and can only be renewed or changed by the Office 365 Access Control team.
  This control is partially inherited from CSE CorpNet.
  These requirements are enforced by domain level policy for the production environment. Microsoft has documented the decision to set the minimum password age to 0 days: Minimum password age enforces the length of time before resetting passwords. Microsoft resets passwords very frequently (sometimes multiple times per day) as Office 365 allows JIT access to the production environment. Having the minimum password length set to zero has no impact to security based on how Microsoft manages passwords.

ia_5_1_b_implementation: |
  Customer Responsibility:
  Office 365 customers are responsible for character changes in compliance with their organizational policies and requirements for their organizational users. Government and non-government customers using ADFS will leverage existing user accounts for their internal domain infrastructures and will use the same password change requirements to access Office 365.

  Customers managing user accounts in Azure Active Directory (AAD) via the SUE portal are not able to automatically enforce password changes that exceed a single character; it is not possible for the server to evaluate the number of characters changed in a password absent reversible password storage, which Office 365 does not support - reversible password storage significantly decreases the security of passwords. In this instance password change requirements will need to be enforced via policy and training of organizational users.

  O365:
  Office 365 accounts are managed by Account Management Tools.  Office 365 enforces at least a 1-character change when new passwords are created. Office 365 does not enforce a 50% change requirement in every new password. Office 365 implements strong password complexity, password expiration, password history, account lockout, and minimum password length to provide mitigation to the risks of not meeting this requirement. Additionally, the use of two-factor authentication provides strong security controls against credential guessing attacks. Office 365 considers these mitigating factors sufficient to address the incremental risk between Office 365 and FedRAMP defined values for the number of changed characters.
  This requirement is enforced by domain level policy for the production environment.

  Government customers using ADFS to manage accounts for their organizational users, and using PKI in their authentication processes, are responsible for validating certificates by constructing a certification path with status information to an accepted trust anchor. ADFS uses the same certification process as the organization's internal domain authentication processes and is not unique to Office 365.

  Microsoft’s corporate PKI has been established to provide a variety of digital certificate services to support operations for Office 365 and for the Microsoft Corporation. The Microsoft Corporate PKI functions as the Certificate Authority (CA) and Registration Authority and provides directory services to manage keys and certificates.

  Office 365 uses role-based certificates to manage access to administrative applications. The certificates are signed by an internal Microsoft CA and are validated against that CA's public key. Office 365 also checks certificates against certificate revocation lists.

  SFB:
  The four certificate categories for Office 365 are physical tokencertificates, customer-specified vendor certificates for servers, external facing Microsoft certificates and internally generated certificates for servers.

  The physical token certificates are used to authenticate users attempting to gain access to the Office 365 environment. EXO has established a PKI infrastructure that includes a root CA and an encryption module that services certificate requests only from the root CA. Active Directory is configured to authenticate management domain physical token certificates against the root CA.

  Server certificates are used to authenticate communication sessions for various protocols (e.g. RDP, TLS 1.2) from client to server as well as server to server. Vendor supplied certificates are obtained through the Office 365 SAN Certificate Request Process. The vendor is considered the trust anchor for these certificates. They are only applicable to customer sessions into the environment, so the customer is responsible for constructing the certification path to the vendor.

  Certificates that are generated internally are generated by the identified trust anchor. These certificates are only used for server to server communications. Microsoft’s corporate PKI has been established to provide a variety of digital certificate services to support operations for Office 365 and for the Microsoft Corporation.

According to MSIT’s standard, InfoSec 1 – General Use Standard, all passwords used to access the Microsoft corporate network or business information must be considered and handled as “information as per the InfoSec #2.0 Information Classification and Handling Standard.”

  Microsoft security policy requires that AD usernames and passwords are never stored or transmitted in the clear or any unencrypted format natively within Windows or while connecting to the Microsoft corporate network. Passwords must not be shared or revealed to anyone other than the authorized user. Additionally, passwords must be promptly changed if they are suspected of being known by unauthorized individuals.

  O365:
  Office 365 implements encryption mechanisms on all communications between partners and between customers using cryptographic certificates issued by CertDojo which are anchored to the Microsoft Root Certificate Authority. In this implementation, the Microsoft Root Certificate Authority is the cryptographic module for Office 365. In order to request a cryptographic certificate, an Office 365 service team administrator must be authenticated to the MSIT managed corporate network. The Office 365 service team administrator navigates to the internal Microsoft site http://ssladmin to request a certificate. The request is routed to the administrator’s manager for approval. Once the certificate is issued, the administrator uses two factor authentication to access Office 365 servers to install the certificate. This process meets the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for authentication to a cryptographic module.

Thus, the responsibility is incumbent upon the customer to uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users) who should have system access.

  The government customer can invite guests and non-organizational users to  SFB and MSTeams, but the guest must be authorized/admitted to the session by the credentialed government customer user for SFB or MSTeams. It is the responsibility of the government customer to follow their own Rules of Behavior and policies around inviting guests to their systems.

 Office 365 tracks and documents security incidents using ticketing tools. Service teams notify the Office 365 Security Incident & Response (SIR) team of possible security incidents using ticketing tools. Likewise, if the Office 365 SIR team identifies a possible incident by themselves, they open a ticket. If the incident is categorized as a security incident, the Office 365 SIR team tracks and documents the security incident response process using a ticket.

 Various ticketing tools are used by the Office 365 SIR team and Service Team Engineering for reporting and tracking incidents are retained indefinitely. As part of the incident management process, the Office 365 SIR team and Service Team Engineering pull, review and attach system logs to tickets according to their troubleshooting guides. These logs can contain and be used as evidence of a security incident. If it is determined that additional evidence is required, the  Office 365 SIR team will work with the service team and Corporate, External and Legal Affairs (CELA) to identify, collect and retain the evidence.

 On a monthly basis, Office 365 SIR team reviews all impacting incidents for the previous month with the leadership/exec team. Impact and resolution of the incident and changes to the "Office 365 Security Incident Response Plan" are covered.

 For each incident, a formal Incident Report is produced by the service teams and augmented with the Office 365 SIR team’s additions. These reports, which include lessons learned, are created for all events with a Sev 1 rating. For incidents of lesser severity, if there are significant lessons learned that have general applicability across Office 365, an incident report is created. The incident reports are maintained by SIR team and are provided to the relevant stakeholders for review.

 The Office 365 SIR team revises the IR plan as necessary to address system and organizational changes or lessons learned from incidents and testing.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Office 365 offers the ability to remediate a data spillage event by using self-service features. These features allow customers to identify, contain, and remediate a data spill, and to perform post spill remediation.  Customers are responsible for ensuring that information not authorized for storage or transmission within Office 365 MT is not stored on or transmitted via Office 365 MT services. If information is spilled, customer administrators with appropriate roles can quickly respond to a data spillage event without needing to contact Microsoft for support by using these self-service features.

 Microsoft Support Services can be leveraged to assist a customer with activities, such as development of customer-specific procedures, policy implementation with regards to spillage and legal hold, modification of existing procedures to leverage the Office 365 self-service tools, and providing government "cleared" resources for spillage activities. Microsoft Support Services, by default, does not have any permissions within the Office 365 service.

 Part 1:
 O365:
 Azure Government has implemented system maintenance procedures in accordance with Microsoft’s Online Services: Physical and Environmental Security Standard. All Microsoft equipment and systems are regularly maintained in order to guarantee operational efficiency. Maintenance of any equipment or system must be performed in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations, carried out by authorized personnel, and recorded in a maintenance ticket.

 Azure Government data centers rely on a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) to manage maintenance schedules and work order management. Work orders are generated based on OEM guidelines and assigned for completion. All maintenance work performed at an Azure Government data center must follow approved instructions captured in a Method of Procedure (MOP) document. A MOP must have data center management approval before work can begin. Completed MOPs are reviewed and receive data center management sign-off to indicate completion. Details of completed MOPs are stored in CMMS and then the work order closed.

 The MA control family applies specifically to systems within the data center that support the critical operations of the data center and provisioning of Azure Government. Examples of maintenance of DC critical environments equipment would be routine maintenance of generators, temperature and humidity systems, or fire suppression systems. An example of maintenance to support Azure Government would be smart hands support of Azure Government assets (e.g. replacing faulty components like server fans or power distribution units). Smart hands maintenance for Azure Government servers and network devices are captured in MSTicketing work tickets.

 Part 1, 2:
 O365:
 This control is inherited from Azure Government, which has a FedRAMP IaaS P-ATO (package ID F1603087869). Azure enforces physical access authorizations for all physical access points to Azure datacenters. The exteriors of the datacenter buildings are non-descript and do not advertise that they are Microsoft datacenters. Main access to Azure datacenter facilities is restricted to a single point of entry that is manned 24x7 by security personnel. Emergency exits are alarmed under video surveillance.

 Access authorizations at Azure datacenters are managed through the Datacenter Access Tool (DCAT). The DCAT reviews access requests for a valid business justification and for appropriate access levels. Upon arriving at the datacenter, the individual on the request must have their identification verified by the Control Room Supervisor against a Microsoft identification badge or government issued identification card or document.

 Azure datacenters (leased and fully-managed) utilize physical access devices, anti-tailgate devices (in leased datacenters), and anti-pass back controls, as well as security officers to control access to datacenters. Azure has required that anti-tailgating alarms be deployed for doors to Microsoft colocation rooms in leased datacenters.

Temporary access badges are stored within the access controlled SOC and inventoried at the beginning and end of each shift. Security officers are staffed 24x7, and physical keys are stored in an electronic key management system which is linked to the physical access system and requires a security officer’s PIN and access badge to gain access. Keys are checked out to specific personnel by matching the person’s access badge to the physical key. A person must have the appropriate access level in the DCAT that would allow them to check out specific keys. Keys are not allowed to be taken offsite.

Access badge readers and similar access devices are linked to the physical security system where status is continuously represented.
pe_3_g_implementation: |
 O365:
 This control is inherited from Azure Government, which has a FedRAMP IaaS P-ATO (package ID F1603087869). Azure datacenters have procedures to implement in cases when an access badge or key is lost or a person is terminated or transferred. In the event of a termination or transfer, the person’s access is immediately removed from the DCAT system and their access badge is removed. This removes any datacenter access the person may have had.  DCM teams also perform quarterly access reviews to validate the appropriateness of the datacenter access list in DCAT.

 Azure does not require the annual re-keying of locks because Azure datacenters do not use physical hard keys as a primary access method to the facility. Microsoft’s policy is that no hard keys may leave the site, and no hard keys are permanently issued to individuals. Azure also mitigates the control risks by requiring annual re-keying through the primary implementation of electronic and biometric access controls, strict assignment of access levels, and controlled distribution and management of keys.  If after an investigation a key was determined to be lost, Azure has procedures in place to determine appropriate action commensurate with the risk that the loss of that specific key has.

These processes ensure that Microsoft collects all security-related, organizational information system-related property prior to the terminated user’s departure.
ps_4_e_implementation: |
 Customer Responsibility:
 Office 365 government customers are responsible for retaining access to organizational information and information systems formerly controlled by terminated individual for their terminated organizational users consistent with their internal policies and guidelines.
 When an Office 365 account is deleted, it becomes inactive. For approximately 30 days after having deleted it, customers can restore the account. For more information about deleting and restoring accounts, see TechNet article “office 365 user account management”: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office-365-user-account-management.aspx

 O365:
 When an employee is terminated from Microsoft, the employee is removed from the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) via a Termination Transaction and approved by the Human Resources Assistant (HRA) or Business Administrator. Once the transaction has been keyed in and approved, Microsoft Accounts and Security teams are notified and access to the information system and buildings is shut off, via the HRIS termination transaction process and/or urgent terminations email template. For involuntary terminations, an urgent request for access termination is submitted via email from HR and all access is immediately disabled. Office 365 does not allow operations to store data in the system, ensuring that no information is inaccessible upon termination of employee.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for reviewing logical access authorizations to Office 365 for their own personnel prior to reassigning or transferring to another position within their organization and granting access to Office 365.

 O365:
 When an employee is reassigned or transfers to a position within a different cost center, a Human Resources Information System (HRIS) transfer transaction is keyed into the HRIS system. A change to the employee's manager in the HRIS will result in an immediate change to the expiration dates for an employee's system access eligibilities in IDM. All eligibilities will expire after 5 days unless the eligibilities are approved by the employee's new manager. When an employee's direct manager is changed, IDM sends a notification to the employee that their eligibility is about to expire (in 5 days). To retain the eligibility, the employee must submit a new "Request Access" form for the eligibility in IDM. Once the employee submits a new Request Access form, the employee's new direct manager is notified by IDM and required to approve the eligibility request.

 Office 365 personnel do not have physical access to the information system.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for modifying access authorizations as needed to correspond with any changes in operational need of their own personnel, due to reassignment or transfer.

 O365:
 Changes in operational need due to reassignment or transfer will trigger a change of manager within the Human Resources Information System (HRIS). This change is sent to IDM, which then requires the new manager to re-approve the access authorization, and if not approved it will be revoked.

 Government customers are responsible for developing and documenting access agreements for organizational information systems.

 O365:
 For internal access Microsoft has developed and documented confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, as well as the Microsoft Employee Handbook access agreements, which Office 365 staff are required to sign as a condition for employment and access to the Office 365 System. Additionally, Microsoft has developed the “Office 365 Rules of Behavior”, which all service team administrators are required to follow when using Office 365 GCC High.

 For external access Microsoft has developed the Master Supplier Services Agreement (MSSA), which documents the policies, procedures and NDAs that apply to vendors and contractors. A signed MSSA between Microsoft and external parties is used to ensure compliance with Microsoft policies on required engagements.
ps_6_b_implementation: |
 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for reviewing and updating the customer access agreements at least annually.

 O365:
 The Microsoft Employee Handbook, confidentiality, non-disclosure, and Office 365 Rules of Behavior, and Master Supplier Services Agreement (MSSA) are reviewed and updated on an as-needed basis, due to changes in laws and regulatory requirements. Microsoft Corporate, External Legal Affairs (CELA) maintains a strong partnership with HR to ensure that any policy updates are legally compliant and company appropriate.

 Office 365 service team administrators are provided with these documents as part of annual security awareness training. Completion of the training constitutes employee acknowledgement and understanding of these documents, and is used in place of a signature.
ps_6_c_implementation: |
 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for ensuring that users with access to Office 365 sign appropriate customer access agreements prior to being granted access, and that employees renew these agreements on an organization-defined frequency.

 Part 1:
 O365:
 Office 365 requires that all employees and contingent staff sign confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements at the time of hire. In addition, employees read and sign the Microsoft Employee Handbook at the time of hire.

 All users, including employees, vendors, and contractors are required to follow the rules of behavior outlined in the Office 365 Rules of Behavior.

 The Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), Employee Handbook, and the Office 365 Rules of Behavior include statements regarding information and asset protection responsibilities. They also describe the penalties for the violation of these responsibilities. A signed confirmation from users indicating understanding and agreement of the NDA is required of all users prior to gaining access to the Microsoft network. The NDA is tracked and enforced by HR while the Service Team PMs are responsible for submitting the agreements after they have been signed.

 Part 2:
 O365:
 Office 365 administrators are privileged users within their respective environments and their access level does not change for their role. Therefore, it is not necessary to re-sign original access agreements to maintain access, as access levels do not change.

 Office 365 administrators and vendors are required to complete annual security awareness training, which includes review of system access agreements. Completion of the training constitutes employee acknowledgement and understanding of these documents, and is used in place of a signature.

Microsoft requires approved screening vendors to submit screening outcomes for third-party personnel directly to Microsoft where they are tracked in HRIS.

 As part of the vendor agreements with third party providers enrolled in the Microsoft Supplier Data Protection program, Office 365 Infrastructure requires third-party providers to notify Office 365 managers within 24 hours about transfers or terminations of third party personnel and within 2 hours for involuntary dismissal. This is to allow Office 365 to revoke or modify access of individuals who possess organizational credentials and/or badges or who have information system privileges.

 In addition, Microsoft maintains vendor guidelines included in all Master Service Agreements with suppliers across Microsoft. These vendor guidelines state that suppliers have responsibility to immediately remove individuals from their Microsoft assignments if suppliers become aware of criminal activity.

 Office 365 implements the acquisitions control through enforcement of the Office 365 Information Security Policy. Security Policy and Associated standards (documented in the Active Framework Controls) dictates that where a third party is allowed to (i) access, process, host or manage Microsoft’s online services’ information assets or information processing facilities, or (ii) add products or services to Microsoft’s online services’ information processing facilities, arrangements must be made in a formal contract to define responsibility and requirements for the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information assets involved.

 It is the role of Corporate, External, & Legal Affairs (CELA) to approve all language included in system acquisition contracts pertaining to the security requirements. This includes the security functional requirements, security strength requirements, security assurance requirements, security-related documentation requirements, requirements for protecting security-related documentation, a description of the information system development environment and environment in which the system is intended to operate, and acceptance criteria, all of which are explained in detail in the documents mentioned above. Pre-existing third-party contracts are amended to include appropriate language upon renewal. This satisfies the acquisition control through effective management of the risks associated with failing to document security requirements in contracts.

 Office 365 follows a life cycle support process for all engineering and development projects.
 The process includes the following phases which implement standard security engineering principles across all Microsoft Online Services systems:
 • Phase 1: Requirements - The Requirements phase includes the project inception—when the organization considers security and privacy at a foundational level—and a cost analysis—when determining if development and support costs for improving security and privacy are consistent with business needs.
 • Phase 2: Design - The Design phase is when the organization builds the plan for how to take the project through the rest of the process—from implementation, to verification, to release. During the Design phase the organization establishes best practices to follow for this phase by way of functional and design specifications, and by performing risk analysis to identify threats and vulnerabilities in the software.
 • Phase 3: Implementation - The Implementation phase is when the organization creates the documentation and tools the customer uses to make informed decisions about how to deploy the software securely. To this end, the Implementation phase is when the organization establishes development best practices to detect and remove security and privacy issues early in the development cycle.
 • Phase 4: Verification - During the Verification phase, the organization ensures that the code meets the security and privacy tenets established in the previous phases. This is done through security and privacy testing, and a security push—which is a team-wide focus on threat model updates, code review, testing, and thorough documentation review and edit. A public release privacy review is also completed during the Verification phase.
 • Phase 5: Release - The Release phase is when the organization prepares the software for consumption and prepares for what happens once the software is released. One of the core concepts in the Release phase is response planning—mapping out a plan of action, should any security or privacy vulnerabilities be discovered in the release—and this carries over to post-release, as well, in terms of response execution. Response planning is performed in coordination with existing security incident response processes.

 The System Owner is responsible for ensuring that the process is followed for all engineering initiatives associated with Office 365 GCC High.

 Microsoft requires all third parties (external information system services) who are engaged with Office 365 to sign a Master Supplier Services Agreement (MSSA). The MSSA requires the third party to comply with all applicable Microsoft security policies and implement security procedures to prevent disclosure of Microsoft confidential information. Microsoft includes provisions in the MSSA and any associated Statements of Work (SOW) with each vendor addressing the need to employ appropriate security controls. Vendors that handle sensitive data must be in compliance with Microsoft vendor privacy practices and data protection requirements. Additionally, Office 365 signs ISAs with external information systems ; ISAs define Office 365 oversight and roles/responsibilities.

 The Office 365 Data Handling Standard maps “Federal information” to the categories “customer content" and “access control data”. Currently, Azure is the only Office 365 external information system service provider that stores or processes these categories. Azure Government has a FedRAMP P-ATO and is required to follow the FedRAMP security control baseline.

 O365:
 Office 365 follows Microsoft system development life cycle which includes specific security considerations and critical security review and approval checkpoints. The "Office 365 Information Security Policy" outlines software usage restrictions for Office 365, and require all applications, including those developed or hosted by and/or purchased from third parties, to undergo a comprehensive security review before entry into Microsoft Online environments. In addition, any new or changed resources may not be deployed or utilized in Office 365 without formal approval as required by Office 365 change management processes.

 Office 365’s implementation of acquisitions control is described in SA-4. Prior to procurement, vendors must meet the requirements to participate in the Microsoft Supplier Program (MSP). All suppliers and purchase orders are vetted through Microsoft’s procurement processes.

 The purchasing and allocation of all hardware components is inherited from Azure Government, which has a FedRAMP IaaS P-ATO (package ID F1603087869). The Microsoft Cloud Supply Chain (MCSC) group consists of six unique teams (Procurement, Customer Operations, Deployment Quality, Supplier Relationship Management, and Spares), each contributing to protecting Azure from threats to the Supply Chain.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for isolating security functions from non-security functions for customer-deployed resources.

 O365:
 All Office 365 servers run modern operating systems. These operating systems maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning a private virtual address space to each process. See the following TechNet article for more information: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/aa366785%28v=vs.90%29

 All Office 365 servers use processor types that implement isolation by means of protection rings with various privilege levels; user code runs in ring 3, while kernel code runs in ring 0. The use of these processors is inherited from Azure Government, which has a FedRAMP IaaS P-ATO (package ID F1603087869).

 At the network level, Office 365 restricts access to security functions. In order to access these security functions, administrators have to use multifactor authentication, and access is monitored and audited. Additionally, Azure’s Infrastructure implements network segmentation/isolation with the use of VLANs.

 Security software, such as antimalware software, is protected using access control lists at the file system level (file permissions). While there are no non-privileged users in Office 365 GCC High, this ensures that only administrators have access to security software.

 Office 365 GCC High’s Infrastructure considers all functions performed by administrators within the Office 365 environment as security-relevant functions. It is a default deny environment, so firewall zones can only communicate to each other on areas that are explicitly designated through firewalls.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for only sharing government customer content with properly authenticated government customer users. There are two mechanisms by which government customers could potentially share government customer content with non-authorized users i.e. guest access to SFB meetings .

 Guest access to SFB meetings, if enabled, allows anyone with a meeting invite to access the meeting lobby. The meeting organizer is responsible for establishing the identity of lobby participants before granting them access to the meeting. Government customers are responsible for disabling guest access to SFB meetings to remain compliant with FedRAMP standards as advised in “Office 365 Complementary Federal User Entity Control”.

 Government customers are responsible for ensuring that no information with a security impact level greater than moderate is stored, processed, or transmitted via the services provided to them by Office 365.

 O365:
 A detailed list of specific technical mechanisms implemented within Office 365 to prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources is documented in "Tenant Isolation in Office 365". Shared resources in Office 365 require each Office 365 G user (including Office 365 service team administrators, customer administrators, and customer users) to hold a unique Active Directory (AD) identifier. Access to shared resources is governed by explicit access allocation, and information is segregated between Office 365 user sessions through AD and Azure Active Directory (AAD).

 O365:
 The Office 365 servers are configured to limit the use of processor and memory resources by process priority. This is a built-in feature of the Windows OS. Additionally, service teams monitor processor and memory utilization spikes and initiate the incident response process if spikes threaten the health of Office 365. Also, process and memory resources are capped per tenant, which prevents any single tenant from interfering with the availability of other tenant’s services.

 Resource caps are "soft caps" meaning that under non-duress operation the processes are able to use whatever resources they need. Under duress (system is at >=97% CPU or <3% available mem) a service called PUMA applies a system enforced throttle per process. This is evaluated every hour and removed once the system is out of the duress state. The per process throttle is based on past usage and agreement with the component team owners.

 If a tenant has hit the process and / or memory cap usage is throttled back to acceptable level. The intent of the soft caps is to maintain critical customer facing operations at all costs. Processor and memory resources management are inherited from pre-existing FedRAMP Authorization for Azure Government (F1603087869)

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for having a process in place to check the validity of the Office 365 Web sites prior to signing on by reviewing the digital certificate on the site to ensure they are the Office 365 Web sites. If government customers are using USGCB baselines, supported web browsers will enforce this review automatically by default and prevent connections if the digital certificate is invalid.

 Government customers are responsible for ensuring that client software is configured to only establish sessions using FIPS 140-2 validated protocols. This can be accomplished by restricting access to the government customer’s ADFS to only internal network traffic. This will force government customers attempting to connect to Office 365 to VPN into the customer’s network or directly be on the network at the time of authentication. When the customer connects (directly or via VPN) to the network it should perform a health inspection that validates USGCB baselines including browser settings to require FIPS 140-2 connections. For more information about configuring customer ADFS server(s) to only allow connections from customer internal networks, see the following TechNet article: http://technet.microsoft.com/enus/library/hh526961(v=ws.10).aspx

 Office 365:
 Office 365 uses encryption to protect the integrity and confidentiality of transmitted information. Specifically, Office 365 provides FIPS 140-2 validated cipher support for customer connections, interconnected system connections, and remote access connections to Office 365.

 For connections to customers, Office 365 is configured to negotiate FIPS validated TLS 1.2 protocols with supported client browsers, though non-FIPS validated protocols are supported for legacy browser support.
 Connections to interconnected systems are made using strictly enforced FIPS validated TLS 1.2 protocols.
 Remote access connections from Office 365 service team administrators are made using strictly enforced FIPS validated TLS 1.2 protocols.

  Office 365 produces, controls and distributes asymmetric cryptographic keys using approved PKI Class 3 certificates. Asymmetric key generation is initiated within Central Admin in the capacity forest where the corresponding certificate will be validated. A public-private key pair is generated by Central Admin. The private key is immediately encrypted and stored in the Central Admin secret store; it is never transmitted outside the boundary and the Central Admin secret store will not allow the private key to be viewed or exported. The Central Admin secret store will only allow the private key to be used to sign requests via API. The corresponding public key is placed in a CER file, which is sent to CertDojo via a FIPS 140-2 validated TLS internal network connection. CertDojo then signs the public key with its root certificate and returns the signed public key for distribution.

 O365:
 Office 365 inherits DNS servers from Azure. Azure System DNS servers act as non-authoritative sources for DNS requests only from clients hosted inside Microsoft Azure. A client makes a DNS query to a system DNS server; the system DNS server in turn queries an authoritative source outside the system. System DNS servers do not support the DNSSEC protocol. This control requires system DNS servers, when requested by clients, to perform origin/integrity verification of the response provided by authoritative sources. The control assumes that the client makes a DNS query of a system DNS server and that the DNS server must then query an authoritative source outside the system. The risk that the external authoritative source has been compromised is mitigated by the origin/integrity verification provided by TLS.

 Microsoft Azure DNS's production servers act as authoritative sources for DNS requests from external clients for various Microsoft Azure domains and will not respond to any DNS queries against zones for which they are not the authority.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for having a process in place to check the validity of the Office 365 Web sites prior to signing on by reviewing the digital certificate on the site to ensure they are the Office 365 Web sites. If government customers are using CIS or STIG baselines, supported web browsers will enforce this review automatically by default and prevent connections if the digital certificate is invalid.

 O365:
 Office 365 uses digital certificates to establish the identity of Terminal Services Gateways (TSGs) as the access point to the Office 365 environment. Digital certificates are used in public key cryptography (PKI) to establish the identity of a server or client for purposes of authentication. This also supports encrypted connections using TLS 1.2, which is resistant to man in the middle attacks.

 All Office 365 servers are located within Azure datacenters. Multiple physical and logical access controls in place mitigate the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. As such, Office 365 has deemed it unnecessary to implement digital certificates for server-to-server connections within the environment.

 O365:
 Office 365 does not allow reuse of TLS session identifiers. TLS session identifiers are invalidated upon termination of the session.

 Sessions rely on Office 365 GCC managed certificate authorities (CAs) for the establishment of secure sessions through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. These certificates, after verification by the Office 365 certificate authorities, facilitate the establishment of protected sessions between sessions at the infrastructure level. Session identifiers are invalidated upon user logout or termination.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for ensuring that customer-deployed resources fail in a known-state for customer-defined types of failures to preserve the system state information in failure.

 O365:
 In order to preserve data in the event of a system failure, Office 365 implements geographic redundancy and data mirroring. As stated in CP-06, Office 365’s Infrastructure employs geo-replication for Office 365 servers which has the ability to establish alternate storage sites geographically. Synchronization is the process of ensuring that files and directories already exist on the replica server and that they are identical to the original copies on the master server. Synchronization occurs before replication.
 Furthermore, Office 365 databases are data replicated through live mirroring. For more details on database mirroring see CP-10(02).

 As discussed in SC-07(18), boundary protection devices fail over to equally secure backup devices. In the event the process fails, the mechanisms fail to a known secure (closed) state, preserving confidentiality and integrity of all data within the system.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for ensuring that customer users are using secure browsers and properly patched information systems to access Office 365.

 O365:
 Office 365 identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws through vulnerability management, incident response management, and patch/configuration management processes. The Office 365 Security Incident Response Program assists with identifying and reporting of information system flaws. Office 365 receives vulnerability-related data from multiple sources of information which include: Microsoft Security Resource Center (MSRC), vendor Web sites, other third-party services (e.g. Internet Security Systems) and internal/external vulnerability scanning of services. Office 365 Security will determine which updates are applicable within the Office 365 environment. Potential changes are tested in advance. Patching schedules are defined by Office 365 Security to install security-relevant software and firmware updates within 30 days for high vulnerabilities, 90 days for moderate vulnerabilities.

 Additionally, the Office 365 PAVC team and Azure analyze and test vendor-supplied software (Qualys scan engine). Flaws found during testing are reported to the appropriate vendor, and vendor patches are tested and applied as they are received.

 Office 365 inherits firmware changes from Azure Government, which is responsible for firmware updates to the Office 365 infrastructure. Azure Government has a FedRAMP IaaS P-ATO (package ID F1603087869).

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for ensuring that customer users are using information systems running anti-malware software to access Office 365.

 O365:
 The use of anti-malware software is a principal mechanism for protection of Office 365 assets from malicious software. The software detects and prevents the introduction of computer viruses, malware, rootkits, worms, and other malicious software onto the service systems. Anti-malware software provides both preventive and detective control over malicious software. System Center Endpoint Protection (SCEP), Windows Defender, Forefront Endpoint Protection (FEP) or Microsoft Endpoint Protection (MEP) is installed as part of the initial build on all systems.
 Additionally, IP scans and quarantines in real time all email and email attachments both entering and leaving the system for viruses and other malware.
si_3_b_implementation: |
si_3_c_implementation: |
 Part 1:
 CIA, CII, EXO, IP, IS, Loki, ORAS, OSI, SCS, SFB, SPO, SUE:
 The following functions are centrally managed by the appropriate anti-malware tool on each endpoint for each service team:
 • Periodic scans of the file system (at least weekly)
 • Real-time scans of files as they are downloaded, opened, or executed

 Anti-malware tools detect files determined to be malicious and send alerts to Office 365 administrators, which triggers the incident response process.

 AFS, Bing, MSTeams, WAC:
 PilotFish utilizes real-time scanning of files as they are downloaded, opened, or executed. If the scanning tool is disabled, a Sev 1 alert is generated.
 PilotFish also monitors for changes to its desired state; deviations from this state will automatically mark the host as unhealthy, remove it from the network, and subsequently tear it down and rebuild.
 Anti-malware tools detect files determined to be malicious and send alerts to Office 365 administrators, which triggers the incident response process.

 Part 2:
 O365:
 When anti-malware tools detect malware, they block the malware and an alert is generated and sent to Office 365 service team personnel, Office 365 Security, and/or Azure. The receiving personnel initiate the Incident Response process. Incidents are tracked and resolved, and postmortem analysis is performed, as discussed in the Office 365 Security Incident Response Plan.

 Part 1:
  O365:
  Service teams have deployed Near Real Time monitoring solutions that generate all real-time alerts and audit logs from both SCOM and repository. All the service team-specific monitoring requirements beyond the base set defined in Office 365 Security Auditing SOP for Office 365 are integrated into a SCOM pack. In addition, service teams upload their logs to a repository service, where they are aggregated and processed. The uploader service generates reports using automated security alerting tools. These automated security alerting tools assist in identifying normal usage of the system and deviations from that normal range. Additionally, they examine records to confirm that the system is functioning in an optimal, resilient, and secure state. Unusual activity is flagged and alerted in Near Real Time, repository also aggregates logs for further review. Any log event that indicates a potential security violation must be immediately brought to the attention of Office 365 Security.

 O365:
 Office 365 monitors for and protects against mining of system data and customer content. All access to Office 365 occurs through remote access to the ORAS or Azure managed Terminal Services Gateways (TSG). The Office 365 Security team monitors remote access for any large data exfiltration through the TSGs. O365 Security uses a robust security monitoring and alerting tool to ingest logs from hosts and other networking infrastructure in the environment, compare these logs to an extensive ruleset, and alert Security personnel when a match is found between the two. Service teams also employ HostIDS to further monitor for data exfiltration at the host level.

 In addition, access to the Office 365 system is limited to a small number of Office 365 cleared service team administrators. Office 365 cleared service team administrators have taken role-based access training, security awareness training and have been background screened.
 If Office 365 becomes aware of any unlawful access to any customer content stored in its equipment or in its facilities, or unauthorized access to such equipment or facilities resulting in loss, disclosure, or alteration of customer content (each considered a security incident), Office 365 will: (a) notify the affected customer of the security incident; (b) investigate the security incident and provide the customer with information about the security incident; and (c) take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the security incident.

 In the event of customer data spillage, upon customer request, Office 365 may assist with the incident including accessing customer data according to the Office 365 Incident Response Policies and Procedures.

 Office 365 receives Near Real Time (NRT) alerting on security events, including the detection of unauthorized network services, through NRT Security Monitoring alerting tools.

 Azure is responsible for detecting and reporting any external unauthorized network services connecting to the system. This control is inherited from Azure Government, which has a FedRAMP IaaS P-ATO (package ID F1603087869). Azure has an automated process in place to detect and alert on network services that have not been authorized or approved by the Azure Change and Release Management process. Azure enforces a default deny policy which restricts communication to certain areas by firewall zones that are explicitly permitted. For any policy change, a detailed request with justification must be submitted and approved by C+AI Security through a standard security process.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government Customers are responsible for discovering, collecting, distributing, and using indicators of compromise to customer-deployed resources.

 O365:
 The Microsoft Office 365 Security collects and uses indicators of compromise from US-CERT, MSRC, C+AI Security SIM, and other external sources. Indicators of compromise are also discovered from audit logs and incident postmortems. These indicators of compromise are distributed to Microsoft Office 365 Security personnel and are used to improve the automated security alerting analysis process. Discovery, and collection of indicators is done through the identification stage of incident response process.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for protecting software and information integrity for customer-deployed resources by employing automated tools that provide notification to customer-defined personnel/roles upon discovering discrepancies during integrity verification.

 O365:
 Office 365 software updates are thoroughly reviewed for any unauthorized changes before entering the production environments as part of the SDL and Change and Release Management processes. Any code changes have to be reviewed and approved before they are deployed to the environment. Additionally, builds are digitally signed before they are deployed. If the integrity verification fails at deployment, the deployment operation fails, and the process needs to be started over. The deployment engine is configured to notify service engineer personnel upon discovery of discrepancies during integrity verification. Service engineer personnel are notified via email.

 The Microsoft Windows Server operating systems provide real-time file integrity validation, protection, and recovery of core system files that are installed as part of Windows or authorized Windows system updates.

 Teams inherit firmware integrity verification notification mechanisms from Azure Government which has a pre-existing FedRAMP Authorization for Azure Government (F1603087869). Azure uses the Config Policy Verifier tool to notify the Azure Networking team on unauthorized changes to network devices on a continuous basis. Config Policy Verifier is Microsoft software. It automatically sends alerts to IcM regarding deviations of correct operations of security functions. Config Policy Verifier alerting performs alerts upon system startup and/or restart and continuously provide event monitoring and alerting to Azure Networking Config Policy Verifier is a real-time solution that performs scanning on a continuous basis.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for automatically shutting down or restarting customer-deployed resources, and/or implementing customer-defined security safeguards when integrity violations are discovered.

 O365:
 The Microsoft Windows Server operating systems provide real-time file integrity validation, protection, and recovery of core system files that are installed as part of Windows or authorized Windows system updates. Windows Resource Protection as this capability is known, will automatically detect and restore the original version of protected files if a program uses an unauthorized method to change those files. When WRP and AppLocker detect unauthorized integrity violations, Vanquish notifies service engineer personnel via email.

 In addition to WRP, on demand validation and recovery of core Windows system files are provided using the System File Checker (sfc.exe) tool.

 The incident response team will investigate any instances of integrity violation that is suspected of being a security incident and respond according to their operating procedures.

 For teams on PilotFish, integrity verification mechanisms are inherited from PilotFish. Integrity checks are performed against PilotFish signatures. If system integrity is compromised, PilotFish will attempt to repair the image. If unsuccessful, it will redeploy a healthy image.

 Additionally, AppLocker detects unauthorized changes to software and information. If an unauthorized change is detected, a Sev 1 alert is raised and sent to Office 365 Security.

 Firmware integrity verification mechanisms are inherited from Azure Government from pre-existing FedRAMP Authorization. Microsoft Azure components have a set of runners, which leverage information captured by Geneva Monitoring to run automated tests for checking the health of the components. Runners are configured to automatically generate alerts if any discrepancies are identified.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Customers are responsible for complying with all applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational requirements in their retention and handling of data within the Office 365 information system.

 O365:
 Office 365 owned assets are retained as appropriate based on retention requirements set by Corporate Records Management and an asset’s classification or based on contractual requirements. Microsoft guarantees retention of tenant data for 30 days after termination and all information is permanently deleted 90 days after termination of service. The classification of assets is included in the Office 365 asset inventory. Corporate Records Management’s Microsoft Documentation Retention Policy describes which Microsoft documents must be kept and for how long.

 Additionally, Office 365 has a comprehensive framework to comply with FedRAMP, SOC I, SOC II, HIPAA, ISO27001, EUMC, and other regulations as necessary. As part of this framework, Office 365 maintains ongoing continuous monitoring programs to assure compliance in post-production deployments.
