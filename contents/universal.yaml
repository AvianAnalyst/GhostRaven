 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for developing and maintaining appropriate Access and Training policies that govern security awareness training activities for their organization and users

 Part 1:
 O365:
 The Office 365 Information Security Policy provides the overarching security guidance for Office 365policies. This document addresses the purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, compliance requirements, and required coordination among the various Microsoft organizations providing some level of support for the security of Office 365. Policies are made available to personnel responsible for implementing awareness and training policies and procedures via SharePoint.

 Part 2:
 O365:
 The Office 365 Information Security Policy contains policies that must be met in the delivery and operation of Office 365. Standards and procedures to facilitate execution of these policies are documented in the Active Framework Controls, Office 365 SOPs, and service team-specific SOPs. These standards and procedures act as adjuncts to the security policy and provide implementation level requirements and details to carry out specific operational tasks. A detailed mapping of Office 365 standards and procedures to each control is available for review. Office 365 SOPs are distributed via SharePoint.

 O365:
 Office 365 provides security and privacy awareness training to all information system users (including managers, senior executives, and contractors) when required by system changes. This is accomplished by requiring all staff to take a New Employee Orientation (NEO) security awareness training course, Standards of Business Conduct, within the first 30 days of their employment or transfer into the organization. This training course is facilitated by CSE and Corporate Security, and encompasses standard business security measures, information security, and user actions to maintain security and to respond to suspected security incidents.

 In addition, all staff are required to take security and privacy awareness training annually after their initial training. Office 365 has implemented the security training control by requiring all new users (employees and contractors) to take the initial security and privacy awareness training at least annually. Non-operational personnel, anyone that is involved in development and quality assurance, are also required to take the mandatory training. In addition, training related to the system being accessed, along with associated procedures, may be required. Security training is also required when there is a significant change to the system environment.

 Office 365 authorizes connections from the information system to other information systems outside of the authorization boundary through the use of vendor agreements, Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), Interconnection Security Agreements (ISA), Terms and Conditions (T&C), and/or Service Level Agreements (SLA). Microsoft has developed the necessary vendor agreements, MOUs, ISAs, SLAs that document connections outside of the Federal authorization boundary. An ISA between Microsoft and customer will be developed if deemed necessary by the customer.

 Microsoft internal connections to other Microsoft services like Azure services are tracked with internal tools. Before an internal connection to an existing Microsoft service can be made, the connection must undergo a security and compliance review and approval process.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Customers are responsible for routing their internet traffic through a TIC. This can be accomplished by restricting access to the government customer’s ADFS to only traffic originating on the government customer’s internal network. This will force government customers attempting to connect to Office 365 to VPN into the customer’s network or directly be on the network at the time of authentication. If the government customer has implemented a TIC on their network, traffic to Office 365 will then be routed through this TIC. For more information, see the following TechNet article: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh526961(v=ws.10).aspx

  O365:
  Office 365 service teams define, document, approve, and enforce logical access restrictions associated with changes by using RBAC enforced by Active Directory (AD) and Azure Active Directory (AAD). All accounts created in support of Office 365 are role-based. Service team personnel request access to, and if approved, are placed in the appropriate security groups according to their roles for supporting the system and using the principles of least privilege.

  Access to the production environment is only allowed to members of specific security groups after approval. A subset of service team personnel has undergone background checks and have gone through the approval process for Operations-level read access to production, used during critical incident escalations.

  Common change processes are scripted in commandlets. These commandlets are checked-in and reviewed through the change management process. The ability to execute these commandlets is restricted to members of appropriate security groups, who can execute them via JIT elevations. System access to perform changes beyond the scope of these pre-approved commandlets is allowed for emergency situations through the use of RDP via Terminal Services Gateways (TSGs), managed by ORAS or inherited from Azure.

  Physical access control is inherited from as documented in the PE control family.

  Physical access to servers and net devices is restricted to authorized personnel through the physical access protections discussed in the PE control family. Changes to servers are made by admins who have access to a particular server.

  Physical access to network devices is enforced by physical protection mechanisms in the datacenters. Access lists for physical access are owned and managed by Datacenter Services.

  Service teams use Active Directory (AD), Azure Active Directory (AAD), Torus and JIT tooling to control access to change functions. AD and AAD accounts define the access that is available and JIT elevation provides an added layer of access control by providing a time limited permission elevation when users need to access those accounts. AD and JIT tools are automated, and actions taken (account creation, change, disabling, removal for AD; account elevation for JIT tools) are automatically audited.

  For teams that use Torus, only pre-approved changes are allowed to the information system. The ability to implement these pre-approved changes is access-restricted to the appropriate security groups. Any commandlet run in Torus is logged per auditing requirements defined by the security team.

  Office 365 develops new code bases at least every 30 days and as part of the continuous monitoring process and pushed out to the servers. Office 365 develops, applies, and controls baseline configurations and changes to baseline configurations following the change and release process. This process ensures that no unauthorized changes are made to baselines. When a change is made to a baseline configuration, all servers with that baseline configuration are redeployed. This ensures that all servers of a particular role are deployed identically. If an attacker were to compromise and change the configuration of an individual server, any anomalous behavior would be detected using Office 365 auditing and monitoring processes. Additionally, any changes made by the attacker would be overwritten upon the next deployment.

  O365:
  Office 365 has determined that enforcing strict code signing poses unacceptable risks to system availability. This is being tracked as an operational requirement in POA&M ITAR-058.
  Code that is not signed is used for operational break/fix troubleshooting. Adding code signing enforcement to these break/fix workflows leads to increased time to deployment. Deploying strict mechanisms to enforce code signing would require engineers to spend more time troubleshooting service issues, resulting in longer outages.

  Additionally, there are compensating controls around the code used for break/fix troubleshooting:
   • Strong configuration management controls and processes ensure that only approved changes are made to the system.
   • Strong least privilege controls limit personnel who have permissions to perform break/fix troubleshooting.
   • Personnel responsible for break/fix troubleshooting are authenticated via multi-factor authentication and undergo background screening.

  O365:
  Office 365 has determined that solutions to fully meet this control pose unacceptable risks to system availability:
   • Strict software whitelisting and integrity verification has proved computationally expensive, resulting in increased server load and decreased performance.
   • Strict integrity verification (including firmware integrity verification) at boot has resulted in significantly increased boot times.
   • Strict whitelisting and integrity verification increases the complexity of break/fix workflows, which leads to increased time to deployment.

  These downsides present an increased risk to service availability because the service is less performant, the service takes longer to recover from outages, and engineers troubleshooting service issues have a decreased ability to quickly respond to issues.

  Compensating controls are in place that achieve similar objectives to strict whitelisting/integrity verification as follows:
   • Office 365 has strong configuration management controls and processes ensuring that only reviewed and approved changes are made to the system.
   • Office 365 uses standardized deployment processes that ensure that server roles are configured reliably and consistently across the service. There is no manual configuration and thus no risk of accidental deviations.
   • Office 365 frequently redeploys the service using these standardized deployment processes. This provides defense-in-depth against change controls being circumvented because manual changes will be quickly overwritten.
   • Integrity verification of core Windows files is implemented using SFC and WRP.
   • Office 365 has the auditing capability to reliably identify who made a change.
   • Office 365 performs vulnerability scanning daily, which can detect vulnerable software and provide defense-in-depth if change controls are somehow circumvented.
   • Office 365 performs a manual reconciliation of its software inventory against software identified by scanning and discrepancies are investigated.
   • Office 365 logs all executed software and performs blacklist detection. If needed, ad-hoc reports can be run to determine if and where software was executed.

  Additionally, Office 365 has implemented blacklist detections.

  Office 365 has adopted this alternative implementation as an operational requirement as documented in POA&M ITAR-059.

 O365:
 Each service team coordinates with the O365 Business Continuity Management (BCM) team to develop and document a contingency plan that:
 • Identifies essential missions and business functions and associated contingency requirements;
 • Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;
 • Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, and assigned individuals with contact information;
 • Addresses maintaining essential missions and business functions despite an information system disruption, compromise, or failure;
 • Addresses eventual full information system restoration without deterioration of the security measures originally planned and implemented; and
 • Is reviewed and approved by designated officials within the organization

 Each service team’s plan is titled “[service team] Business Continuity Plan”.

 Service teams that are outside the Office 365 organization but maintain resources within the Office 365 boundary are required to meet the requirements of this control but might vary in approach. For example, AFS falls under the Azure organization and they align to a unified ISCP for all of Azure rather than maintain their own plan.
cp_2_b_implementation: |

  The Office 365 Information Security Policy provides the overarching security guidance for Office 365. This document addresses the purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, compliance requirements, and required coordination among the various Microsoft organizations providing some level of support for the security of Office 365. The Office 365 Information Security Policy is distributed to roles providing support for Office 365 identification and authentication via SharePoint.

  Part 2:
  O365:
  Standards and procedures to facilitate execution of these policies are documented in the Active Framework Controls, Office 365 SOPs, and service team-specific SOPs. These standards and procedures act as adjuncts to the security policy and provide implementation level requirements and details to carry out specific operational tasks. A detailed mapping of Office 365 Standards and Procedures to each control is available for review. Office 365 SOPs are distributed via SharePoint.

  For password-based authentication, Office 365 stores and transmits only encrypted representations of passwords. Passwords are stored and transmitted using a one-way function to hash the password value. These hashes are not reversible, and the actual password is never stored or transmitted in clear text. Password transmission sessions are themselves encrypted using TLS 1.2.

  Customer Responsibility
  Government customers using ADFS to manage accounts for their organizational users are responsible for managing the risk imposed by users with multiple accounts on customer-deployed resources (e.g., having different authenticators on all systems, employing some form of single sign-on mechanism, or including some form of one-time passwords on all systems).

  O365:
  Office 365 uses multifactor authentication for network access by Office 365 personnel through the use of IAL, AAL, FAL level 3 and FIPS 140-2 validated YubiKeys or approved IAL, AAL, FAL level 3and FIPS 140-2 validated TPM modules.

  All Microsoft users connect to the system via ORAS or Azure managed Terminal Services Gateways (TSGs) as described in AC-17; the TSGs require the user to present a certificate bound to the card (something you have) with a PIN (something you know). This ensures that personnel use different authenticators when accessing the two systems and prevents an attacker from gaining access to both systems if one set of authenticators is compromised. Authenticators are environment-specific; an authenticator configured for access to one Office 365 environment cannot be used to grant access to a different Office 365 environment.

  Office 365 mitigates the risk of compromise presented by individuals having multiple accounts by establishing single sign-on through central account management and account provisioning for the Office 365 environment. Office 365 domain accounts are provisioned for remote access to the Office 365 environment. Compromise is further mitigated through the use of two-factor authentication using Office 365 issued YubiKeys and PINs.

 O365:
 The Office 365 Security Incident & Response (SIR) team provides centralized incident management and response for Office 365. The Office 365 SIR team reviews the annual security training provided to all personnel with access to Office 365. Training is provided to new and current Office 365 personnel on how to detect potential incidents and how to hand off the investigation of those events to the SIR team. The training takes place within 10 days of assuming an incident response role or responsibility. Additionally, the Office 365 SIR team publishes the Office 365 Security Incident Response Plan (IR plan), and a wiki addressing Security Incident FAQs along with a "battlecard" with live incident instructions for Office 365 personnel.

 O365:
 Service teams include functional exercises as part of incident response training. Part of the training replicates a real incident and walks personnel through the incident response process. Additionally, incident response tests/exercises are considered in-place training and are used to support other onsite training for new employees and other support staff with incident roles. Personnel are not made aware that they are being tested during incident response tests.

 As part of the service team-specific incident management procedures, each team provides additional information and training to provide an understanding of the team’s distinct responsibilities and accountabilities in support of incident management.

 The incident response team uses job shadowing of live-incidents due to the centralized nature of the incident response function in Office 365 and the availability of job-shadowing within the incident response team. Office 365 considers job shadowing of live incidents a preferred and more effective alternative to simulated training mechanisms. On the job training provides a more thorough and realistic incident response training environment by indoctrinating all stakeholders with the incident response procedures in real time.

 The Office 365 SIR team is responsible for incorporating lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into procedures, training, and tests and exercises.

 O365:
 The Office 365 Security Incident Response Plan describes the incident handling process for all incidents, including incidents generated by insider threats. The incident handling process consists of the following stages:
 1.	Detect (identify anomalous or suspicious activity and initiate the incident response process)
 2.	Assess (triage the issue to determine initial severity and ownership)
 3.	Diagnose (troubleshoot and classify the event)
 4.	Stabilize & Recover (perform mitigation and repair)
 5.	Close (perform post-incident analysis and reporting, and adjust incident response procedures as needed)

 Additionally, Office 365 Security may engage the Microsoft Network Security team to provide support and guidance on forensic investigations when the scope of investigation includes employees or contingent staff working at Microsoft.

 Through the Incident Management process, the Azure C+AI Security Operations Center (SOC) team handles insider threat scenarios, such as, but not limited to:
 	• Malicious network activity

 Part 1,2,3:
 O365:
 Office 365 has developed and implemented an incident response (IR) plan through the adoption and implementation of the Office 365 Security Incident Response Plan. The document provides guidance for addressing each category of incident, provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall organization, and describes the structure and organization of the incident response capabilities.

 Part 4:
 O365:
 The IR plan establishes criteria for categorizing and reporting incidents (including false positives, security incidents, potential security breaches, and incidents with privacy impact) and explains the different phases of the incident response lifecycle. Details for each of the phases are explained in the plan, including SLAs which can be measured against to provide objective capability metrics. The plan also identifies the internal partners, cross team contacts, roles and responsibilities, and lists the individuals and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature the incident response capability. The IR plan also accounts for the unique nature of various service teams within Office 365 by incorporating processes that can differ based upon specialized requirements.

 As described in the IR plan, incidents are owned by senior individuals. Those senior level individuals are appointed by management to drive remediation efforts and serve as liaison for communications with the Communications Manager, Office 365 Security Incident & Response (Office 365 SIR) team, and other members of the response team.

 Part 5:
 O365:
 The IR plan provides guidance for classifying the incidents and assigning severity. It also provides the characteristics that could be associated with incidents to help categorize the incidents into one of the following four categories: false positive, security incident, potential security breach, incident with privacy impact. Security incidents are tracked in a ticketing system where they are categorized and assigned a severity rating. Security incidents include, but are not limited to: e-mail viruses, rootkits, worms, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, inappropriate use of network resources, and any other type of unauthorized, unacceptable, or unlawful activity involving Office 365 computer networks or data processing equipment; and compromise, disclosure, or use of information that occurs outside its intended purpose.

 Part 6:
 O365:
 The IR plan define metrics for incident response capability and include the resources to maintain and mature the IR capability. The IR plan establishes criteria for categorizing and reporting incidents (including false positives, security incidents, potential security breaches, and incidents with privacy impact) and explains the different phases of the incident response lifecycle. Details for each of the phases are explained in the plan, including SLAs which can be measured against to provide objective capability metrics. The plan also identifies the internal partners, cross team contacts, roles and responsibilities, and lists the individuals and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature the IR capability.

 Part 7:
 O365:
 As described in the IR plan, incidents are owned by senior individuals. Those senior level individuals are appointed by management to drive remediation efforts and serve as liaison for communications with the Communications Manager, Office 365 SIR team, and other members of the response team.

 Part 8:
 O365:
 The IR plan is reviewed and approved annually by the Office 365 Security Incident & Response (SIR) team.
ir_8_b_implementation: |
 O365:
 The IR plan is posted on the internal Office 365 SharePoint. The IR plan is also communicated as a part of the annual security training provided for Office 365 personnel. When updates are made, the personnel filling roles and responsibilities named in the plan are notified via email.

 In addition to Microsoft staff, FedRAMP personnel will also be notified.

Policies are distributed to roles providing support for security planning via SharePoint.

  Part 2:
  O365:
  Standards and procedures to facilitate execution of these policies are documented in the Active Framework Controls, Office 365 SOPs, and service team-specific SOPs. These standards and procedures act as adjuncts to the security policy and provide implementation level requirements and details to carry out specific operational tasks. A detailed mapping of Office 365 Standards and Procedures to each control is available for review. Office 365 SOPs are distributed to roles providing support for security via SharePoint.

  Part 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9:
  O365:
  The Office 365 SSP provides an overview of the security requirements for Office 365 and the systems and applications within. Additionally, it contains a description of the security controls that are in place to meet those requirements.

  The SSP is created in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-18, Revision 1, which contains guidance on security planning. This includes accurately defining the Office 365 accreditation boundary, as well as describing the operational environment, the security controls that are applicable to the system, and the system interconnections.

  The SSP documents the security categorization of the system based on the typical information being stored, processed or transmitted in Office 365.

  The sponsor's Authorizing Official (AO) approves the SSP as part of the package submission and granting of the Authority to Operate (ATO).

  Office 365 establishes coordination requirements among organizations in order to determine if security-related activities are going to affect Office 365.

  Office 365 plans and coordinates security-related activities to ensure they do not adversely affect operations. Key operating personnel from each service team assist with change control board and policy reviews that relate to security activities. Individuals assigned to these roles understand the significance of the ongoing security-related activities (security assessments, audits, system hardware and software maintenance, vulnerability scanning and patching, security certifications, and testing exercises), the potential impact on the system, and understanding what is required to support such activities. If activities involve Azure, they are included in planning as well.

  All full-time employees and contingent staff must sign appropriate agreements to acknowledge the terms and conditions of their employment and their understanding and acceptance of the Microsoft corporate employment policies. All Office 365 staff are required to sign confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements (NDA), as well as the Microsoft Employee Handbook, at the time of hire as a condition for employment.

  A signed confirmation from Microsoft users indicating understanding and agreement of the NDA is required of all staff upon hire to Microsoft.

  Office 365 service team administrators are provided with all of these documents as part of annual security awareness training. Completion of the training constitutes employee acknowledgement and understanding of these documents, and is used in place of a signature. Additionally, the training ends with a test to verify the user’s understanding; passing the test is required and results are tracked by Office 365.

Microsoft defines the transfer or reassignment actions to implement through the use of the Human Resources Information System (HRIS), which is managed by Microsoft Human Resources. When an employee transfers to a position within a different cost center, an HRIS transfer transaction is keyed into the HRIS system. A change to the employee's manager in the HRIS will result in an immediate change to the expiration dates for an employee's system access eligibilities in IDM. All eligibilities will expire after 5 days unless the eligibilities are approved by the employee's new manager. When an employee's direct manager is changed, IDM sends a notification to the employee that their eligibility is about to expire (in 5 days). To retain the eligibility, the employee must submit a new "Request Access" form for the eligibility in IDM. Once the employee submits a new Request Access form, the employee's new direct manager is notified by IDM and required to approve the eligibility request.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for ensuring that no information with a security impact level greater than high is stored, processed, or transmitted via the services provided to them by Office 365.

 O365:
 Office 365 has completed an Assessment and Authorization (A&A) package to be authorized to operate at FIPS 199 High impact level. Based on FIPS 199 standards, Office 365 service teams identified a selection of information types based on system components within Office 365 core offerings.

 Utilizing this selection, Office 365 categorized information types and evaluated the impact on the organization from compromise of confidentiality, loss of integrity or lack of availability (CIA).

 Because Office 365 does not have control over the information customers store within the system, government customer agencies/departments must separately categorize their data in agreement with FIPS 199 and NIST 800-60 to ensure that the security category of information types collected, processed, or stored in Office 365 does not exceed High impact for confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability.
ra_2_b_implementation: |
 O365:
 The security categorization for Office 365 has been conducted and is documented in detail in section 2.2 of this SSP. The overall security categorization has been assessed at the High impact level for confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) as determined in accordance with FIPS 199 guidelines. The security categorization process took into consideration supporting rationale for impact-level decisions and involved appropriate stakeholders and senior-level organizational officials (program management, system owner) to review and approve the final security categorization activity.
ra_2_c_implementation: |
 O365:
 Microsoft has provided the FIPS 199 Security categorization assessment in the Office 365 security authorization package for the review and approval of customer agencies that may leverage the Office 365 Security Authorization Package.

 O365:
 As part of establishing an Information Security Management System ("ISMS") for Office 365, a risk assessment methodology was developed to provide a structured approach to risk management and to prioritize and direct Office 365 Risk Management activities. This methodology has been designed in compliance with NIST SPs 800-30 and 800-37, based on the following four phases, to accomplish a successful risk management process. Details of the methodology are in the Office 365 Risk Management Policy.

 1.	Identify – Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk identification provides the list of risks which exist in the environment and provides a basis for all other risk management activities
 2.	Assess – The risk assessment considers the potential impact of an information security risk to the business and its likelihood of occurrence; determine appropriate risk treatment plan to reduce risk to a desirable level
 3.	Report – Risk reports provide managers with the data they need to make effective business decisions and to comply with internal policies and industry regulations
 4.	Monitor – Risk groups perform testing and monitoring activities to evaluate whether processes, initiatives, functions, and/or activities are mitigating the risk as designed

 The Risk Assessment Assess phase begins with identifying risks, establishing a risk level by determining the likelihood of occurrence and impact, and finally, identifying controls and safeguards that reduce the impact of the risk to an acceptable level.

 O365:
 Office 365 business owners annually perform a business risk assessment using NIST SP 800-30 and 800-37 guidelines to ascertain the risk associated with operating Office 365 and to ensure financial and operational viability. The results of the risk assessment are documented in business and capital planning documentation.

 Office 365 Trust annually reviews existing assessments and performs security assessments to understand the risk posture of the service and to ensure security standards compliance. The results of the security assessment are captured in a SAR.
ra_3_d_implementation: |
 O365:
 Office 365 submits risk assessment results to Office 365 management including the O365 Trust Program Managers.
ra_3_e_implementation: |
 O365:
 Office 365 Trust ensures that a risk assessment is conducted at least annually, or whenever there are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of the system. The assessments follow the process described in part a of this control.

 All vulnerabilities identified by the vulnerability scanning process are automatically classified by risk. Vulnerability remediation is conducted in accordance with Office 365 policy. High-risk vulnerabilities are remediated within 30 days. Moderate-risk vulnerabilities are remediated within 90 days. Low-risk vulnerabilities are remediated within 180 days.

 Vulnerabilities are tracked through remediation by Office 365 service teams. In the event where patching during the timeframe is infeasible and on case-by-case basis, service groups may request exceptions.
ra_5_e_implementation: |
 O365:
 Office 365 Security provides a reporting interface to allow authorized Office 365 personnel to see the details of vulnerabilities associated with the environment. The reporting interface provides high-level / technical reports (covering information such as servers, vulnerabilities, CVE IDs, breakdowns of vulnerable hosts, and remediation steps, etc.).

 All development in Microsoft Office 365 must follow the SDL process detailed in SA-03 for all engineering and development projects. The SDL process includes the following:
 Addressing security requirements: The Requirements phase of the SDL includes the project inception—when the organization considers security and privacy at a foundational level—and a cost analysis—when determining if development and support costs for improving security and privacy are consistent with business needs.

 Identifying standards and tools/documents tools and configurations: The Implementation phase is when the organization creates the documentation and tools the customer uses to make informed decisions about how to deploy the software securely. To this end, the Implementation phase is when the organization establishes development best practices to detect and remove security and privacy issues early in the development cycle.

 Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes: During the Verification phase, the organization ensures that the code meets the security and privacy tenets established in the previous phases. This is done through security and privacy testing, and a security push—which is a team-wide focus on threat model updates, code review, testing, and thorough documentation review and edit. A public release privacy review is also completed during the Verification phase.

 O365:
 Azure implements OneDDOS for the Office 365 service teams as defense against single point and distributed network flooding denial of service attacks. Individual service teams request OneDDOS deployment from Azure.

 OneDDOS is a solution for network-wide, non-intrusive reporting, anomaly detection and intelligent mitigation. Using flow data, SNMP and BGP updates, OneDDOS learns normal traffic and routing behavior across hundreds of routers and thousands of interfaces, and correlates the traffic patterns with the topology data to build logical data models. This information enables network and security operations staff to detect and mitigate threats to availability, improve network/service performance and make better investment decisions concerning capacity planning, service offerings and traffic management.

 In addition, service teams use redundant server implementation within each data center as well as mirrored active/active data centers to enhance availability of services. The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle requires planning for software/logic-based denial of service attacks and minimizing their potential effects.

 Office 365 monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key internal boundaries within the system through the use of controlled devices at the network boundary and at key points within the network. The overarching principle of network security is to allow only connection and communication that is necessary to allow systems to operate, blocking all other ports, protocols and connections by default. ACLs are the preferred mechanism through which to restrict network communications by source and destination networks, protocols, and port numbers. Approved mechanisms to implement networked-based ACLs include: Tiered ACLs on routers managed by Azure, firewall rules, Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs), and host-based firewall rules.

 The only publicly-accessible components of Office 365 are the ORAS or Azure managed terminal services gateways (TSGs)load balancers and the public-facing server roles. All non-publicly-accessible Office 365 components connect to the load balancers via physically-separate network interfaces on subnets that are logically separated from internal subnets. Customers will determine whether publicly accessible components are appropriate for their needs.
sc_7_c_implementation: |
 O365:
 Office 365 connects to external networks or information systems only through Azure’s managed networks. The network interfaces provide boundary protection using tiered ACLs and are arranged in accordance with organizational security architecture. Pre-approved communications are described by Azure as follows:

 The ingress ACL applies to network traffic as it enters a subnet; the point of implementation of the ACL is the gateway interface(s) of the subnet. Ingress ACLs permitting network traffic to cross between different properties, environments, or AD domains are more restrictive that ACLs permitting network traffic within the same property, environment, and AD domain; these restrictions are labeled accordingly.

 O365:
 All inbound and outbound traffic is controlled and monitored through a limited number of network access points at the boundary and at key points within the system. Service team connections into the environment are restricted and controlled through ORAS or Azure managed Terminal Services Gateways (TSGs), or remote administration services. Each service team has one or more groups of TSGs behind a load balancer to limit the access points for administration traffic, and customer traffic passes through a load balancer as well. All entry points are monitored and generate audit logs and alerts in real time.

 Azure is responsible for managing network connections between Office 365 and external networks and enforces restrictions on Office 365’s behalf.

 O365:
 Office 365 maintains a documented, approved traffic flow policy for managed interfaces (deny all, permit by exception). The Office 365 Security team is responsible for approving and monitoring exceptions to the "Firewall Rule and Tiered ACL Guidelines" document.
sc_7_4_c_implementation: |
 O365:
 Office 365 uses ACLs and encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data being transmitted across each interface. Approved mechanisms to implement networked-based ACLs are: ACLs and network firewall rules managed by Azure, Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs), and host-based firewall rules.

 Office 365 service teams also implement encryption mechanisms on all communications between interconnected systems and between customers. All encryption modules are operated in compliance with FIPS 140-2. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of communications between service teams, interconnected systems, and customers are protected. Further details of this encryption are provided in SC-08.
sc_7_4_d_implementation: |
 O365:
 Office 365 maintains a deny all, permit by exception traffic flow policy for all service teams. Exceptions to the traffic flow policy and changes to the exception list are based on operational needs and granted for a duration specific to these needs. Changes are requested through ticketing tools, must be approved by the Change Advisory Board (CAB) and are reviewed annually as described in part e of this control.
sc_7_4_e_implementation: |
 O365:
 Exceptions to traffic flow policy are reviewed by service teams at least as part of the data flow diagram review process managed by Office 365 Trust.

 After traffic flow policy review, any rules that are determined to be no longer needed to support an explicit mission/business need are removed. Requests for removal follow the same process as requests to add rules.

 Office 365 does not allow VPN connections into the environment. All administrative remote access to Office 365 is terminated at the Terminal Server Gateways (TSGs). Access to the TSGs is remote; there is no VPN network connectivity between the remote device and Office 365 networks. The remote device only has access to a remote desktop session terminated at the TSG and therefore there is no capability to bridge the connection to an external network.

 Customer Responsibility:
 Government customers are responsible for preventing unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed interfaces.

 O365:
 Office 365 monitors for and protects against mining of system data and customer content. All access to Office 365 occurs through remote access to the ORAS or Azure managed Terminal Services Gateways (TSG). The Office 365 Security team monitors remote access for any large data exfiltration through the TSGs. O365 Security uses a robust security monitoring and alerting tool to ingest logs from hosts and other networking infrastructure in the environment, compare these logs to an extensive ruleset, and alert Security personnel when a match is found between the two. Service teams also employ HostIDS to further monitor for data exfiltration at the host level.

 In addition, access to the system is limited to a small number of Office 365 cleared service team administrators. Office 365 cleared service team administrators have taken role-based access training and security awareness training and have been background screened.

 If Office 365 becomes aware of any unlawful access to any customer content stored in its equipment or in its facilities, or unauthorized access to such equipment or facilities resulting in loss, disclosure, or alteration of customer content (each considered a security incident), Office 365 will: (a) notify the affected customer of the security incident; (b) investigate the security incident and provide the customer with information about the security incident; and (c) take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the security incident.

 O365:
 Office 365 isolates security tools/mechanisms from the rest of Office 365 by implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of the system. Examples of isolated components include: automated NRT security monitoring and alerting tools, PAVC, ORAS or Azure managed Terminal Services Gateway (TSGs), and Incident management systems.

 Microsoft Azure has implemented multiple mechanisms for isolating the customer environment, infrastructure components and administrative tools. These mechanisms include VLAN isolation, VM-Switch/HostOS to isolate VMS from one another, unique keys for each storage account, and Administrative/diagnostic tools.

 Administrative personnel are able to access network, data storage, and computing devices within the system and change their configuration (e.g. update firewall rules, restrict network access, remove users) as required during the incident response process. The C+AI Security Operations Center (SOC) team maintains the capability to dynamically reconfigure information system components, including the ability to disable accounts, change ACLs, and quarantine assets if determined necessary by Office 365 Security in an incident response scenario.

 The Office 365 inherits the SOC)network layer isolation capability from Azure, which has a pre-existing FedRAMP Authorization (F1603087869). Microsoft Azure administrators and infrastructure personnel have the capability to isolate or segregate network devices or servers by various means, including but not limited to:
 	• Physical network disconnection
 	• Removal from load balancer rotation
 	• VLAN isolation

 Any of these actions can be performed in real-time as required.

 O365:
 Office 365 uses encryption to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information and detect changes to information during transmission. Specifically, Office 365 provides FIPS 140-2 validated ciphers that include integrity validation for customer connections, interconnected system connections, and remote access connections to Office 365.

 For connections to customers, Office 365 is configured to negotiate FIPS validated TLS 1.2 protocols with supported client browsers, though non-FIPS validated protocols are supported for legacy browser support.

 Connections to interconnected systems are made using strictly enforced FIPS validated TLS 1.2 protocols.
 Remote access connections from Office 365 service team administrators are made using strictly enforced FIPS validated TLS 1.2 protocols.

 Office 365 DoD's FIPS 140-2 encryption modules used for transmitted information are certified by NIST via certificates 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 2351, 2352, 2353, 2354, 2355, 2356, 2357, 2931, 2932, 2933, 2934, 2935, 2936, 2937, 2938.

 Customer Responsibility:
 The customer is responsible for maintaining the availability of information in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys by users. Customers have the ability to use availability keys to recover data if a customer key is lot. Details about using customer keys to encrypt data can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/customer-key-overview?view=o365-worldwide

 O365:
 If an Office 365 administrator loses his or her YubiKey, he or she follows standard corporate processes to obtain a new one. The new YubiKey will be associated with the same account, ensuring that no information is lost. Office 365 service teams store their Storage Account Keys within a secure Secret Store, which tracks and monitors access to secrets. This ensures that the Storage Account Key will never be lost.

 The use of cryptography within the Office 365 environment is employed with remote access sessions of users and link encryption for inter- Office 365 datacenter traffic. As such, data loss due to loss of keys by users is not a concern to Azure Infrastructure and is further mitigated through the geo-redundant mirroring of services in Office 365.

 O365:
 Office 365 inherits DNS servers from Azure Government . Microsoft Azure DNS shared services, as reflected in the boundary, provide name and address resolution. Fault tolerance is built into the service through redundancy at multiple levels (multiple DNS server clusters and multiple servers per cluster) and deployment at multiple Microsoft Azure datacenter facilities which are geographically separated. DNS shared services also leverages network controls to restrict type of hosts that can access an authoritative DNS server in a particular role.

 The implementation incorporates a hierarchy of secondary/primary DNS servers. Static DNS zone/records are replicated/pulled from central source either acting as Primary DNS or a SQL server to the associated secondary servers. Data from these primary sources are backed up and monitored with the security incident and event management tool.

 Additionally, the Microsoft Azure DNS servers that are providing external accessible authoritative DNS are deployed on completely different hardware versus the DNS servers that are being used for recursive resolution.

Security remediation will be implemented as follows:
 	• Remediation for High Risk vulnerabilities will be implemented within 30 days of the vulnerability mitigation being released by the vendor.
 	• Remediation for Medium Risk vulnerabilities will be implemented within 90 days of vulnerability the vulnerability mitigation being released by the vendor.

 In the event where patching during the timeframe is infeasible, service groups may request exceptions, which are very limited and reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Exceptions and risks identified during the course of vulnerability remediation are tracked in Archer for stakeholder and Office 365 Security review. Office 365 Security also verifies degree of compliance using vulnerability scanners deployed in Office 365.

 O365:
 The Microsoft Windows operating systems on Office 365 information systems provide file integrity validation, protection, and recovery of core system files that are installed as a part of the original installation or authorized system updates, detecting unauthorized changes.

 For teams on PilotFish, integrity verification mechanisms are inherited from PilotFish. Integrity checks are performed against PilotFish signatures. If system integrity is compromised, PilotFish will attempt to repair the image. If unsuccessful, it will redeploy a healthy image.

 Additionally, AppLocker detects unauthorized changes to software and information. If an unauthorized change is detected, a Sev 1 alert is raised and sent to Office 365 Security.

 Office 365 has determined that solutions to fully meet this control pose unacceptable risks to system availability. However, the following compensating controls are in place to achieve integrity verification control objectives:
 	• Strong configuration management controls and processes ensuring that only reviewed and approved changes are made to the system.
 	• Standardized deployment processes that ensure that server roles are configured reliably and consistently across the service.  There is no manual configuration and thus no risk of accidental deviations.
 	• Office 365 frequently redeploys the service using these standardized deployment processes.  This provides defense-in-depth against change controls being circumvented because manual changes will be quickly overwritten.
 	• Integrity verification of core Windows files is implemented using System File Checker (SFC) and Windows Resource Protection (WRP).
 	• Office 365 has the auditing capability to reliably identify who made a change.
 	• Office 365 performs vulnerability scanning daily, which can detect vulnerable software and provide defense-in-depth if change controls are somehow circumvented.
 	• Office 365 performs a manual reconciliation of its software inventory against software identified by scanning and discrepancies are investigated.

 Firmware integrity verification mechanisms are inherited from Azure Government from pre-existing FedRAMP Authorization. Microsoft Azure components have a set of runners, which leverage information captured by Geneva Monitoring to run automated tests for checking the health of the components. Runners are configured to automatically generate alerts if any discrepancies are identified. Azure also utilizes Qualys for integrity scanning along with Azure Security Monitoring (ASM) to reduce the risk of tampering on software components and devices within the Microsoft Azure operating environment. ASM works as an extension of the Microsoft Azure monitoring system which has components that observe, analyze and report on security events in Microsoft Azure operating environment. It complements the Azure security model by examining constraints that should remain valid at all times, including configuration settings. Azure uses the Network Automation tool to notify the Azure Networking team on unauthorized changes to network devices on a continuous basis.

 Office 365 software updates are thoroughly reviewed for any unauthorized changes before entering the production environments as part of the SDL and Change and Release Management processes. Any code changes have to be reviewed and approved before they are deployed to the environment. If the integrity verification fails at deployment, the deployment operation fails, and the process needs to be started over. The deployment engine is configured to notify service engineer personnel upon discovery of discrepancies during integrity verification.

 Teams using Azure inherit verification mechanisms from pre-existing FedRAMP Authorization for Azure Government. Azure components have a set of runners, which leverage information captured by Geneva Monitoring to run automated tests for checking the health of the components. Runners are configured to automatically generate alerts if any discrepancies are identified.

 Azure reassesses the integrity of software and information by monitoring of events reported via Windows Resource Protection (WRP). Network devices are monitored via the Network Automation tool on at least a monthly basis. Both WRP and Network Automation tool are continuously scanning (real-time) the environment for changes in the environment that would constitute a change in the integrity of software in the system.

 Office 365 follows system development methodology and security guidelines outlined in the Office 365 Information Security Policy. The process addresses requirements around input data validation within applications. Office 365 has implemented information validation through checking of data inputs.

 Thorough code reviews and testing are completed during the Verification Phase prior to software being put into a production environment. The code reviews and testing check among others for cases of SQL injection, format string vulnerabilities, XSS, integer arithmetic, command injection, and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

 Applications within Office 365 have the capability to use drop down menus for granular control configuration, allowing selections from a predefined set of permissible actions and basic edit checks on modifiable fields to ensure accuracy, completeness, validity, and authenticity of input information. For example, basic validation checks on fields used to capture file names, search criteria, etc.

 Office 365 host servers require that information that is input to be in the form of machine-recognizable language in specific syntax or format, or the information will be rejected.

 In addition, Office 365 leverages the intrusion detection/prevention service provided by Azure, OneDDOS, to validate incoming DNS requests. OneDDOS provides the ability to identify malformed DNS requests and will alert and respond to malicious requests.

 Office 365 owned assets are retained as appropriate based on retention requirements set by Corporate Records Management and an asset’s classification, or based on contractual requirements. Microsoft guarantees retention of tenant data for 30 days after termination and all information is permanently deleted 90 days after termination of service. The classification of assets is included in the Office 365 asset inventory. Corporate Records Management’s Microsoft Documentation Retention Policy describes which Microsoft documents must be kept and for how long.

 Additionally, Office 365 has a comprehensive framework to comply with FedRAMP, SOC I, SOC II, HIPAA, ISO27001, EUMC, and other regulations as necessary. As part of this framework, Office 365 maintains ongoing continuous monitoring programs to assure compliance in post-production deployments.
